The mass murder of Armenians in 1915, and the\ninɻuenza epidemic that began while the war was still being fought, were two of its\ndestructive by-products. The ɻight of Serbs from Serbia at the end of 1915 was another\ncruel episode in which civilians perished in large numbers; so too was the Allied naval\nblockade  of  Germany,  as  a  result  of  which  more  than  three-quarters  of  a  million\nGerman civilians died.\nTwo very diʃerent wars were fought between 1914 and 1918. The ɹrst was a war of\nsoldiers,  sailors  and  airmen,  of  merchant  seamen  and  civilian  populations  under\noccupation, where individual suʃering and distress were on a massive scale, particularly\nin the front-line trenches. The second was a war of War Cabinets and sovereigns, of","in the front-line trenches. The second was a war of War Cabinets and sovereigns, of\npropagandists and idealists, replete with political and territorial ambitions and ideals,\ndetermining the future of Empires, nations and peoples as sharply as the battleɹeld.\nThere were times, particularly in 1917 and 1918, when the war of armies and the war\nof ideologies combined, leading to revolution and capitulation, and to the emergence of\nnew national and political forces. The war changed the map and destiny of Europe as\nmuch as it seared its skin and scarred its soul.\nAs a schoolboy in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, I was very\nconscious of the First World War, although it had ended twenty-seven years earlier. The\nschool porter, ‘Janitor Johnson’, a former Royal Marine, was a veteran of the naval\nattack on Zeebrugge in 1918, and was said to have been recommended for an award for\nvalour there. The headmaster, Geoʃrey Bell, had won the Military Cross on the Western","valour there. The headmaster, Geoʃrey Bell, had won the Military Cross on the Western\nFront, but had paciɹst instincts which he made known to the boys. One of my ɹrst\nhistory masters, A.P. White, had also fought in the trenches: he would march up and\ndown the classroom with a broom over his shoulder, singing military songs. When I\nbegan work on this book his letters from the trenches were published, revealing great\nsuʃering and sensitivity. My father’s elder brother, my uncle Irving, had fought on the\nSomme: his experiences had scarred him, and we boys in the family were warned not to\nquestion him. He died as I was writing this book, at the age of ninety-three.\nDuring my National Service in 1954 and 1955, the First World War was an ever-\npresent memory. The infantry regiment with which I trained, the Wiltshires, had lost a\nbattalion at Reutel, in the Ypres Salient, when 1,000 men were all but wiped out, and","battalion at Reutel, in the Ypres Salient, when 1,000 men were all but wiped out, and\nthe few survivors were taken prisoner in October 1914. Another battalion had been all\nbut  wiped  out,  in  a  few  minutes,  on  the  slopes  of  Chunuk  Bair,  on  the  Gallipoli\nPeninsula, in 1915. A third battalion had been trapped by German naval gunɹre on the\nSalonica Front in 1917. During my academic researches, whatever subject I was working\non, whether the British Empire in India at the turn of the century or the establishment\nof Soviet rule in the Ukraine in the 1920s, the First World War continued to impinge on\nmy researches. My supervisor on Indian history, C.C. Davies, had been wounded on the\nWestern Front and was still troubled by his wound. My work on historical geography in\nwww.frenchpdf.com","the early 1960s took me to Arnold Toynbee’s ɻat in London. On his mantelpiece were\nphotographs of half a dozen young men in uniform. I asked him who they were. He\ntold me they were his closest friends at university before 1914: all had been killed in\nthe trenches.\nOver  several  decades  my  travels  took  me  to  many  of  the  war  zones  and  places\nassociated  with  the  war.  In  1953,  encouraged  by  one  of  my  history  masters,  Alan\nPalmer, I travelled through several of the regions whose war memorials introduced me\nto the diʃering perspectives on the war: and also to Vienna, where the Hofburg and the\nBallhausplatz recalled both the ageing Emperor and his Foreign Ministers; to Ljubljana,\nwhich  as  Laibach  had  been  one  of  the  cities  whose  Slav  population  sought\nindependence from Austria and whose soldiers chafed at their role in maintaining the\nHapsburg Empire; and to Venice, threatened in 1917 by the imminent arrival of the\nAustrian army.","Hapsburg Empire; and to Venice, threatened in 1917 by the imminent arrival of the\nAustrian army.\nIn June 1957, in Sarajevo, I stood on the spot where Gavrilo Princip had ɹred the\nfatal shot in June 1914. Even under the Yugoslav Communist regime Princip was hailed\nas one of the forerunners of national independence. A concrete paving stone was set\nwith two footsteps, commemorating the act which plunged Europe into its four-year\nconɻict.  In  Belgrade  that  year  I  looked  across  the  river  to  where  the  Austrians  had\nbombarded the Serb capital on the ɹrst day of war. A decade later I went with my\nfather  to  the  Western  Front:  we  stayed  at  Arras,  to  the  east  of  which  the  military\ncemeteries are the last relics of the battles of 1917 and 1918, and at Ypres, where we\nlistened each evening at eight o’clock to the Last Post, sounded at the Menin Gate by\ntwo members of the Ypres Fire Brigade.\nWhile the buglers played under the vast archway of the Menin Gate, all traɽc was","While the buglers played under the vast archway of the Menin Gate, all traɽc was\nstopped. The cost of their work was paid for in part by a legacy from Rudyard Kipling,\nwhose only son was killed at Loos. On the walls and columns of the monumental gate\nare carved the names of 54,896 British soldiers killed in the salient between October\n1914  and  mid-August  1917  who  have  no  known  grave.  On  the  stonework  are  the\nshrapnel  marks  of  the  ɹghting  there  in  the  Second  World  War.  The  last  of  the\nstonemasons  were  still  at  work  engraving  the  names  of  1914–18  when  the  German\narmies  arrived,  as  conquerors,  in  May  1940.  The  stonemasons  were  repatriated  to\nBritain.\nFrom the Menin Gate, my father and I walked through the salient, trench maps in\nhand, reading at each battle site the accounts given in General Edmond’s multi-volume\noɽcial history, the letters and recollections of soldiers, and the poetry. We stood in","oɽcial history, the letters and recollections of soldiers, and the poetry. We stood in\nsilence, as all visitors do, at the Tyne Cot Memorial at Passchendaele, on which are\ncarved the names of a further 34,888 soldiers killed in the salient between mid-August\n1917 and the end of the war in November 1918, of whom no trace was found suɽcient\nto identify them for burial. In the cemetery in front of the memorial are more than\n11,000 individual named graves. Not even the well-mown grass, the carefully tended\nɻower beds and the ɹfty-year-old trees could lessen the shocking impact of so many\nnames and graves. Not far away, at Menin, which was held by the Germans for all but\none month of the war, we visited the military cemetery where 48,049 German soldiers\nare buried.\nFifteen  years  after  my  visit  to  the  site  of  the  assassination  of  the  Archduke  Franz\nwww.frenchpdf.com","Ferdinand in Sarajevo, where the First World War could be said to have started, I made\nthe journey to the woodland clearing near Rethondes in France, to see a replica of the\nrailway carriage in which the Germans signed the armistice in November 1918. It was\nin the same carriage that Hitler insisted on receiving the French surrender in June 1940.\nMany  links  between  the  two  wars  are  a  reminder  that  only  twenty-one  years  lay\nbetween them. Many of those who fought in the trenches in the First World War were\nleaders in the Second World War, like Hitler, Churchill and de Gaulle, or, like Rommel,\nZhukov, Montgomery and Gamelin, became commanders in the second. Others, like Ho\nChi Minh, who volunteered to serve with the French as a Vietnamese orderly in the First\nWorld  War,  and  Harold  Macmillan,  who  fought  and  was  wounded  on  the  Western\nFront, rose to prominence after the Second World War.","Front, rose to prominence after the Second World War.\nIn 1957 I visited the battle zones on the Russo-Turkish border, and the towns where\nhundreds of thousands of Armenians were massacred in the ɹrst year of the war. Ten\nyears later I was in the military cemetery in Gaza, where the headstones, set specially\nlow  because  of  the  possibility  of  earthquake,  record  the  deaths  of  the  thousands  of\nsoldiers who perished in one of the ɹercest Anglo-Turkish clashes. I have stood on the\nspot just outside Jerusalem where two British soldiers, up early one morning in search\nof  eggs,  saw  approaching  them  a  group  of  dignitaries,  including  priests,  imams  and\nrabbis, and were oʃered, instead of food, the surrender of the Holy City. Starting in\n1969, I travelled for three consecutive years to the Gallipoli Peninsula, reading aloud\nfrom  Aspinall-Oglander’s  two-volume  oɽcial  war  history,  and  from  other  works,  at","from  Aspinall-Oglander’s  two-volume  oɽcial  war  history,  and  from  other  works,  at\nmany of the landing beaches, gullies and hilltops of the peninsula. The contrast between\nits modern beauty and stillness, and the knowledge of the ɹghting and suʃering there in\n1915, has never ceased to haunt me.\nDuring my work on Winston Churchill, I also read aloud, in the courtyards of the\nfarms  where  he  wrote  them,  the  daily  letters  from  Churchill  to  his  wife  from  the\ntrenches of the Western Front, in which he recognised the endurance of those who could\nnot return, as he could after six months, to the comfort of civilian life in London. Eight\nyears before the outbreak of war in 1914, in a private letter to his wife from German\narmy manoeuvres at Würzburg, to which he had been invited by the Kaiser, Churchill\nwrote: ‘Much as war attracts me and fascinates my mind with its tremendous situations,\nI feel more deeply every year—& can measure the feeling here in the midst of arms—","I feel more deeply every year—& can measure the feeling here in the midst of arms—\nwhat vile & wicked folly & barbarism it all is.’\nIn  1991,  a  few  months  after  the  fall  of  the  Iron  Curtain,  I  was  in  the  newly\nindependent Ukraine, where I wandered through the former Austrian barracks in the\nformer  border  town  of  Brody,  through  which  the  Russian  army  marched  with  such\nconɹdence in 1914 during its initial triumph, and out of which it was driven within the\nyear. Despite the decision of Lenin and the Bolsheviks to pull out of the war in March\n1918, ɹghting on the Eastern Front continued, mostly in the form of a civil war, and\nthen as a Russo-Polish war, for two years longer than in the west. Along the road from\nBrody to Lvov I passed the great bronze cavalry horse and rider who point (or pointed\nthen,  before  all  things  Communist  were  pulled  down)  with  such  triumph  towards","then,  before  all  things  Communist  were  pulled  down)  with  such  triumph  towards\nWarsaw. This striking pair commemorated the Bolshevik attempt to overrun Poland in\n1920. Like the eʃorts of their Russian compatriots six years earlier to retain Poland,\nthey had fought and died in vain. In Warsaw I have stood several times over the years at\nwww.frenchpdf.com","the  unknown  soldier’s  memorial:  it  commemorates  not  an  unknown  soldier  of  the\n1914–18  war,  as  at  Westminster  Abbey  or  beneath  the  Arc  de  Triomphe,  but  an\nunknown victim of the Russo-Polish War of 1920.\nDuring four decades, many soldiers have spoken to me about their experiences on all\nfronts. As a young soldier myself, in 1954 and 1955, I visited old people’s homes where\nthe often shattered survivors of the trenches were living and dying. In the course of my\nhistorical researches, which began in 1960, I met many old soldiers, sailors and airmen\nfrom all the belligerent armies. Their recollections, and the letters and documents that\nthey had kept, were a window on the past. So too was the personal encouragement of\none of the historians of the First World War, Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, and three of my\nsenior colleagues when I went to Merton College, Oxford, as a junior research fellow in","senior colleagues when I went to Merton College, Oxford, as a junior research fellow in\n1962, Alistair Hardy, Hugo Dyson and Michael Polanyi, each of whom had seen the\nnoblest and the ugliest sides of that distant war, Hardy and Dyson as soldiers on the\nWestern Front, Polanyi as a medical officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army.\nDuring my Churchill work I met the eighty-year-old General Savory, who had served\nat Gallipoli, and who invited me to run my ɹnger along the hollow in his skull caused\nby a Turkish bullet. He had gone on to serve in Mesopotamia and Siberia. An airman,\nRichard Bell Davies, who had also fought at Gallipoli, where he won the Victoria Cross,\nproduced  from  his  wallet  a  piece  of  wartime  toilet  paper  on  which  was  printed  a\nportrait of the German Kaiser with the words ‘Wipe your bottom on me’.\nTwo  other  soldiers  who  had  served  on  the  Western  Front  from  the  ɹrst  weeks","Two  other  soldiers  who  had  served  on  the  Western  Front  from  the  ɹrst  weeks\ninɻuenced me by their friendship and by their writings. One was the French painter\nPaul Maze, DCM, MM with bar, Croix de Guerre, who came to live in England after the\nFirst World War, and who escaped from France as the German army entered Paris in\nJune 1940. He had served on the Western Front as a reconnaissance expert for four\nyears,  a  witness  to  each  of  the  main  British  oʃensives.  The  second  soldier  was  the\nBritish politician Major-General Sir Edward Louis Spears, MC, who entered Parliament\nafter the First World War, and in June 1940 brought General de Gaulle to England. Both\nMaze and Spears were able, in their books and in their conversation about the First\nWorld War, to give a portrait in words of the actions and moods of Flanders, the hopes\nof the soldiers, and the perils of the four-year journey from the declaration of war in\n1914 to the armistice in 1918.","1914 to the armistice in 1918.\nOn 3 September 1976, a day still vivid in my memory, I lunched with Anthony Eden\n(then Earl of Avon) at his home in Wiltshire. He talked about episodes of the Second\nWorld War, the outbreak of which had taken place exactly thirty-seven years earlier,\nand in which his twenty-year-old son Simon, a Pilot Oɽcer in the Royal Air Force, had\nbeen killed in action in Burma in June 1945. We spoke of the British decision to go to\nthe aid of Greece in 1941 and the dangers of a Russian collapse, or even a separate\nNazi-Soviet peace, in 1942.\nThere  were  many  echoes  in  our  talk  of  the  First  World  War,  including  Britain’s\ndecision in 1915 to help Serbia (through the same port city of Salonica that Greece was\nhelped in part in 1941) and the impact of the Russian withdrawal from the war in\n1917.  One  of  Eden’s  most  vivid  memories  was  of  being  told,  while  he  was  in  the","1917.  One  of  Eden’s  most  vivid  memories  was  of  being  told,  while  he  was  in  the\ntrenches of the Western Front, that his brother Nicholas had been killed in action at the\nBattle of Jutland in 1916. Nicholas Eden, in charge of a gun turret on the Indefatigable,\nwww.frenchpdf.com","was just sixteen when he died.\nHarold Macmillan also helped me in my Churchill work, in correspondence, and in\ntalks at his home and mine, but it was not until I was writing this book that I learned\nthat his spidery handwriting, limp handshake, and the somewhat ungainly shuʀe of his\nwalk, were each the result of wounds sustained in action in 1916.\nMy travels taught me that there was no area of Europe free from the memories and\nmonuments  of  the  First  World  War.  Cities  such  as  Warsaw and  Lille,  Brussels  and\nBelgrade  knew  the  full  rigours  of  occupation  in  two  world  wars.  From  Prague  and\nBudapest, Berlin and Vienna, Constantinople and Athens, Paris and Rome, London and\nNew York, Cape Town and Bombay, troops had left for the war zones, and those who\nreturned, after the shock and prolongation of battle, found cities, in Europe at least,\nwhere  privation  and  grief  had  replaced  the  earlier,  brief  enthusiasms.  In  each  city\nmonuments recorded the loss.","monuments recorded the loss.\nWhile  travelling,  I  studied  the  wording  and  the  iconography  of  war  memorials\neverywhere. These testiɹed to every form of destruction, from the graves of individual\nsoldiers and civilians to the monuments recording the death of more than half a million\nhorses  in  the  war  zones,  and  a  further  15,000  drowned  on  their  way  to  war:  these\nmemorials  form  a  stark,  often  beautiful,  sometimes  grotesque  reminder  of  the\ndestruction.  Their  unveiling  and  dedication,  such  as  that  in  1936  of  the  Canadian\nmemorial on Vimy Ridge, prolonged the impact of retrospection. Even after the Second\nWorld War it was the sight of the bemedalled veterans of the First World War that made\nthe greatest impact at Armistice Day parades. In Boulogne in 1974 I watched the parade\nof old soldiers of both world wars, led by a stooped survivor of the Battle of the Marne","of old soldiers of both world wars, led by a stooped survivor of the Battle of the Marne\nof sixty years earlier, who was given pride of place at the head of the procession.\nThe  battles  formed  the  framework  and  daily  reporting  of  the  war,  but  mutinies,\nstrikes  and  revolution  echoed  the  footsteps  of  the  ɹghting  men,  as  did  the  work  of\nmillions in factories  and  labour  battalions.  Mustard  gas  was  an  extra  hazard  for  the\nɹghting men. Submarines sent thousands of merchant seamen, soldiers and civilians to\nunmarked graves. Aerial bombardment added a civilian dimension of terror. Hunger\nand privation were the lot of millions of citizens behind the lines.\nMy  own  researches  led  to  several  books  in  which  the  First  World  War  had  an\nimportant place, among them Sir Horace Rumbold, Portrait of a Diplomat, which covered\nthe outbreak of the war from the perspective of a British diplomat in Berlin; the third","the outbreak of the war from the perspective of a British diplomat in Berlin; the third\nand fourth volumes of the Churchill biography, in which the Dardanelles, the Western\nFront and the munitions war each had its place; and The Atlas of the First World War,\ncovering every front and aspect of warmaking. The impact of the war on Jewish and\nArab aspirations in the Middle East was the subject of three chapters in Exile and Return,\nThe Struggle for a Jewish Homeland. The impact of the war on the peace treaties and the\ninter-war years was a feature of the letters and documents that I published in 1964 in\nBritain and Germany Between the Wars.\nAlso in 1964, shortly after I had given an Oxford typing agency the manuscript of my\nbook The European Powers 1900–1945, the head of the agency, Mrs Wawerka, asked to\nsee me. In the book I had ascribed to Austria some of the responsibility for the coming\nof war in 1914. This had puzzled and distressed her. She had been born and educated in","of war in 1914. This had puzzled and distressed her. She had been born and educated in\nVienna; as a Jewess she had been forced to leave Austria in 1938 but she knew for a\nwww.frenchpdf.com","fact that Austria was innocent of any responsibility for the events of 1914. The blame\nshould be put (and ought to have been put by me) upon the Serbs and Russians.\nThis episode made a strong impact on me, as did Mrs Wawerka’s description of the\ndesperate hunger in Vienna after the war, and the unfairness, as she saw it, of the post-\nwar settlement that dismantled the Hapsburg Empire.\nFor some it was a war to punish and chastise. For others it became the war to end\nwar.  Its  name,  the  Great  War,  indicated  its  hitherto  unprecedented  scale.  It  was\nfollowed, however, by a second even more destructive war, and by other ‘lesser’ wars\nthroughout the world. In January 1994 there were an estimated thirty-two wars being\nwaged somewhere on earth. The First World War continues to have its place in the\ndiscussion of these modern conɻicts. On 26 December 1993, while I was writing this\nbook, a British television journalist, commenting on the lack of any Christmas truce in","book, a British television journalist, commenting on the lack of any Christmas truce in\nBosnia, reported, against the background of a deep trench: ‘Around Vitez the trench\nsystem is a reminder of the First World War, complete with mud.’ The trench as shown\nwas not particularly muddy, or waterlogged, nor was it under shellɹre. But the imagery\nof the First World War has remained for eighty years, and through several generations. A\nrelatively short period of time, a war that lasted for four years and three months, has\ninspired, puzzled and disturbed the whole century that followed.\nSome of the political changes that the First World War created were as destructive as\nthe war itself, both of life and of liberty, and were to perpetuate tyranny for more than\nhalf a century. Some of the frontier changes of the First World War, intended to put\nright long-standing wrongs, are still a cause of dispute and conflict today.","right long-standing wrongs, are still a cause of dispute and conflict today.\nIn 1923, in the introduction to his book The Irish Guards in the Great War, Rudyard\nKipling wrote: ‘The only wonder to the compiler of these records is that any sure fact\nwhatever should be retrieved out of the whirlpools of war.’ Since the ɹrst shots were\nɹred eighty years ago, authors have pursued their researches into both the main and the\nobscure episodes of the war, and into the puzzles. This book is an attempt to convey my\nown researches, readings, feelings and perspectives on an event that, like the Holocaust\nin later years, left a searing mark on the western world. It is also an attempt to tell,\nwithin  the  framework  of  commanders,  strategies  and  vast  numbers,  the  story  of\nindividuals.\nIf each of the nine million military dead of the First World War were to have an\nindividual page, the record of their deeds and suʃering, their wartime hopes, their pre-","individual page, the record of their deeds and suʃering, their wartime hopes, their pre-\nwar lives and loves, would ɹll twenty thousand books the size of this one. Individual\nsuʃering is not something that is easily conveyed in a general history, yet all historians\ntry to do it. On 3 December 1993, I was struck by three short sentences in a review by\nMeir  Ronnen  of  two  books  on  the  First  World  War.  The  review  appeared  in  the\nJerusalem Post, where Ronnen wrote: ‘Millions died or suʃered in the mud of Flanders\nbetween 1914–18. Who remembers them? Even those with names on their graves are by\nnow unknown soldiers.’\nNo single book can redress that balance, though several ɹne books have tried to do\nso, among them, most recently, those in Britain by Lyn Macdonald and in France by\nStephanie Audouin-Rouzeau (one of the books being reviewed by Meir Ronnen; the\nother was a biography of the poet Isaac Rosenberg, killed in action on April Fools’ Day","other was a biography of the poet Isaac Rosenberg, killed in action on April Fools’ Day\n1918).

Yet the nature of a\nEuropean  war,  as  opposed  to  a  colonial  venture,  was  little  understood.  What  was\nknown were the many swift forays by superior forces against distant, feeble foes, the\nvictory of machine guns against spears, of massive naval guns against antique cannon.\nHowever  frightening  those  conɻicts  could  be  for  those  who  took  part  in  them,  the\ngeneral public at home had little sense of anything terrible.\nWhy should war in Europe be feared? Shortly before the outbreak of war in 1914 a\nFrench colonel, who had been a teenager when Germany invaded France in 1870, was\nlistening to a group of young oɽcers drinking to the prospect of war and laughing\nabout the possibility of conɻict. He brought their laughter to an abrupt end with the","about the possibility of conɻict. He brought their laughter to an abrupt end with the\nquestion: ‘And do you think that war is always gay, toujours drôle?’ His  name  was\nHenri-Philippe Pétain. Two years later, at Verdun, he was to witness one of the worst\nmilitary slaughters of the twentieth century.\nThe French soldiers whose laughter Pétain brought to an abrupt end were heirs to a\ntradition of Franco-German enmity that had culminated more than forty years earlier,\non 11 May 1871. For on that day, in the Swan Hotel at Frankfurt-on-Main, the German\nChancellor Otto von Bismarck signed the agreement transferring all of Alsace and much\nof Lorraine to Germany. That day, in the German-occupied city of Metz, guns ɹred in\ncelebration of the triumph. In the classrooms of the French Jesuit College of St Clement,\nwrote the British historian Basil Liddell Hart in 1931, ‘the message of the guns needed\nno interpreter. The boys jumped to their feet.

The superintendent, rising more soberly,\ncried, “Mes enfants!”—and then, unable to say more, lowered his head and joined his\nhands as if in prayer. The memory of that terrible moment was not eʃaced from the\nminds of the students.’ One of those students was the nineteen-year-old Ferdinand Foch,\nwho resented the fact that defeat had come before he could be sent into battle.\nNot everyone in the newly-united Germany was satisɹed by the victory over France.\nOther  German  ambitions  were  stirred  as  the  Empire  gained  industrial  strength.\nAspirations for colonial expansion, for naval power at least as great as that of Britain,\nfor inɻuence over the Muslims of Asia, for a dominant part in the counsels of Europe,\nintensiɹed the German sense of inferiority.

The need","late, it seemed, into the race for power and inɻuence, for empire and respect. The need\nfor a further war, and for the overwhelming military strength essential to win it, was the\nconclusion  of  the  book Germany  and  the  Next  War,  published  by  a  retired  German\ncavalry oɽcer, Friedrich von Bernhardi, in 1912. Bernhardi had ridden as a conqueror\nthrough Paris in 1870. In his book he stressed the need for Germany either to make war\nor to lose the struggle for world power. The ‘natural law, upon which all the laws of\nnature rest’, he wrote, was ‘the law of the struggle for existence’. War was ‘a biological\nwww.frenchpdf.com","necessity’. German soldiers forty years younger than he were soon to test this conɹdent\ntheory on the battlefield, and to die testing it.\nThe  war  of  1870  had  been  the  last  war  of  the  nineteenth  century  between  the\nEuropean powers. Three thousand soldiers had been killed on each side at the Battle of\nSedan. In the civil strife that followed in France, more than 25,000 Communards had\nbeen executed in Paris, by Frenchmen. Wars, and their aftermath, were known by this\nexample to be costly in human lives and unpredictable, even vicious, in their outcome.\nAfter 1870 the German, French, Belgian and British Empires each had its saga of war,\ndefeat and slaughter overseas. Napoleon III’s son the Prince Imperial was among the\nhundreds  of  British  soldiers  killed  in  1879  by  Zulus  at  and  after  the  Battle  of\nIsandlwana.

At the turn of the century a German Colonel, Erich von\nFalkenhayn, won a reputation for ruthlessness during the international expedition to\ncrush the Boxer Rebellion in China, the occasion during which the Kaiser William II\nlikened the German troops to the Huns, thus coining a phrase that was eventually to be\nused against them. ‘Just as the Huns a thousand years ago under the leadership of Attila\ngained a reputation by virtue of which they live in the historical tradition,’ he said, ‘so\nmay the name of Germany become known in such a manner in China that no Chinese\nwill ever dare again look askance at a German.’\n1\nThese often distant but always bloody wars oʃered a warning to those who cared to\nlisten. In 1896 the British poet and classicist A. E. Housman expressed the cruelty of war\nin his poem ‘A Shropshire Lad’:\nOn the idle hill of summer,\nSleepy with the flow of streams,","in his poem ‘A Shropshire Lad’:\nOn the idle hill of summer,\nSleepy with the flow of streams,\nFar I hear the steady drummer\nDrumming like a noise in dreams.\nFar and near and low and louder\nOn the roads of earth go by,\nDear to friends and food for powder,\nSoldiers marching, all to die.\nEast and west on fields forgotten\nBleach the bones of comrades slain,\nLovely lads and dead and rotten;\nNone that go return again.\nFar the calling bugles hollo,\nHigh the screaming fife replies,\nGay the files of scarlet follow:\nWoman bore me, I will rise.\nHousman’s warning sentiments were echoed ɹve years later in the British House of\nCommons,  by  Winston  Churchill,  then  a  26-year-old  Conservative  Member  of\nParliament. Having experienced ɹghting in India, in the Sudan and in the Boer War,\nChurchill found himself when back in London listening to calls for an army capable of\nɹghting  a  European  foe.  ‘I  have  frequently  been  astonished  to  hear  with  what","ɹghting  a  European  foe.  ‘I  have  frequently  been  astonished  to  hear  with  what\ncomposure and how glibly Members, and even Ministers, talk of a European war,’ he\ndeclared on 13 May 1901, three months after entering Parliament, and he went on to\nwww.frenchpdf.com","make the point that, whereas in the past wars had been fought ‘by small regular armies\nof professional soldiers’, in the future, when ‘mighty populations are impelled on each\nother’, a European war could only end ‘in the ruin of the vanquished and the scarcely\nless fatal commercial dislocation and exhaustion of the conquerors’.\nDemocracy, Churchill warned, would be ‘more vindictive’ than the courts and cabinets\nof old: ‘The wars of peoples will be more terrible than those of kings.’ Ten years later,\non 9 August 1911, as German war fever was being whipped up against Britain and\nFrance over Germany’s claim for a port on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, the German\nSocial Democrat leader August Bebel warned the Reichstag that a European war could\nlead to revolution. He was laughed at as an alarmist, one parliamentarian calling out:\n‘After every war things are better!’\nThe rivalries from which wars sprang could not be assuaged by the logic of anti-war","The rivalries from which wars sprang could not be assuaged by the logic of anti-war\nsentiment. The opening decade of the twentieth century saw many such rivalries and\nresentments among those nations for whom peace, trade, industry and the spread of\nnational prosperity seemed the true necessities, challenges and opportunities. In France,\nthe loss of the territories annexed by Germany in 1871 rankled for four decades. The\nadvice of the French patriot Léon Gambetta, ‘Think of it always, speak of it never’, rang\nin French ears. The black cloth which covered the statue of Strasbourg in the Place de la\nConcorde was a constant visual reminder of the loss of the two eastern provinces. Karl\nBaedeker’s guide for Paris, published in Leipzig in 1900, commented on the draped\nstatue: ‘The Strasburg is usually heavy with crape and mourning garlands in reference to\nthe  lost  Alsace.’  For  her  part  Germany  had  many  territorial  ambitions,  particularly","the  lost  Alsace.’  For  her  part  Germany  had  many  territorial  ambitions,  particularly\nbeyond her eastern border. Despising Russia, the Germans hoped to annex the western\nPolish  provinces  of  the  Russian  Empire,  and  also  to  extend  German  inɻuence  over\ncentral Poland, into Lithuania, and along the Baltic coast. It was as if the Empire of\nWilliam II would redress the balance of power ɹrst disrupted by Peter the Great two\nhundred years earlier, and, forty years after his death, by Catherine the Great.\nThe Russia of Nicholas II was not without ambitions of her own, particularly in the\nBalkans, as the Slav champion of a Slav State, Serbia, which was continually struggling\nto enlarge her borders and to reach the sea.

A  branch line  running  eastward  from  Baghdad  was\nintended to reach as far as the Persian oilɹelds, a direct challenge to the inɻuence that\nBritain and Russia had established in that very region only seven years before.

The people ought rather to be\naccustomed to the idea of such a war beforehand.’\n3\nThe question of the readiness of the public mind to accept war was one that Moltke\nunderstood, and was concerned about. At the beginning of 1913 he went so far, as did\nBethmann-Hollweg, to warn their Austrian opposite numbers not to make war with\nSerbia, despite the Serbian desire to occupy Albania.

On 18 October 1913 the\nAustrian  Government  sent  an  ultimatum  to  Belgrade,  demanding  the  evacuation  of\nAlbania by Serbian forces within eight days. The Serbs complied. That day a British\ndiplomat, Eyre Crowe, noted with truth, and a certain prescience: ‘Austria has broken\nloose from the concert of Powers in order to seek a solution single-handed of a question\nhitherto treated as concerning all Powers.’ On the following day the German Acting","hitherto treated as concerning all Powers.’ On the following day the German Acting\nForeign  Minister,  Dr  Alfred  Zimmermann,  told  the  British  Ambassador  in  Berlin,  Sir\nEdward Goschen: ‘He had been surprised that the Emperor of Austria endorsed a policy\nwhich,  under  certain  circumstances,  might  lead  to  serious  consequences,  but  he  had\ndone so, and that made it clearer still that restraining advice at Vienna on the part of\nGermany was out of the question.’\nIn these ɹnal fourteen words lay the seeds of a European war. After the Austrian\nultimatum was sent, the Kaiser sent a telegram of congratulations both to the Emperor\nFranz Josef, and to Franz Josef’s Heir Apparent, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

His warning, ɹrst published in 1909, was\ntranslated into French, German, Italian and Russian, achieving more than ten English-\nlanguage printings by 1913. Angell stressed that the great industrial nations, Britain, the\nUnited States, Germany and France were ‘losing the psychological impulse to war, just\nas we have lost the psychological impulse to kill our neighbours on account of religious\ndiʃerences’.  How  could  it  be  otherwise,  he  asked.  ‘How  can  modern  life,  with  its\noverpowering  proportion  of  industrial  activities  and  its  inɹnitesimal  proportion  of\nmilitary,  keep  alive  the  instincts  associated  with  war  as  against  those  developed  by","military,  keep  alive  the  instincts  associated  with  war  as  against  those  developed  by\npeace?’ Even the Prussian Junker ‘becomes less of an energumen as he becomes more of\na scientist’.\nAngell was far from alone in pointing out that the powers whose rivalries made their\npublic opinions so warlike were themselves tied closely together by links of free trade\nand  industrial  interdependence.  In  June  1914  it  was  a  company  owned  jointly  by\nBritish  and  German  investors  that  gained  exclusive  rights  for  oil  exploration  in\nMesopotamia.

That day, as the British naval squadron sailed from Kiel, the British\nadmiral signalled to the German Fleet: ‘Friends in past, and friends for ever.’ Also on\nJune 30, Sir Arthur Nicolson, the senior civil servant at the British Foreign Oɽce, wrote\nto the British Ambassador in St Petersburg: ‘The tragedy which has just taken place in\nSarajevo will not, I trust, lead to further complications.’\nOn July 3 it was announced from Berlin that the Berlin-Baghdad railway would be\ncontinued  southward  to  Basra,  giving  Germany  an  outlet  on  the  Persian  Gulf,  and\noverland access to the Indian Ocean. That summer, however, Britain was within a few\nmonths of concluding an agreement with Germany, so that the railway would not be a\ncause of conflict between them.\n***","cause of conflict between them.\n***\nThe German attitude towards Austria was crucial. On July 4 the German Ambassador to\nLondon, Prince Lichnowsky, having just returned from Berlin, told the former British\nSecretary of State for War, Lord Haldane, that he was ‘very worried’ about the state of\nopinion in Germany. ‘The general feeling in Berlin’, Lichnowsky reported, was ‘that\nSerbia could not be allowed to go on intriguing and agitating against Austria and that\nGermany must support Austria in any action she proposed to take.’ That same day the\nGerman Ambassador in Vienna, Count Tschirschky, told a senior Austrian oɽcial that\nGermany would support Austria-Hungary ‘through thick and thin’, and he added: ‘The\nearlier Austria attacks the better. It would have been better to attack yesterday than\ntoday; and better to attack today than tomorrow.’\nTo this advice the Kaiser added, on July 5, an essential dimension of active German","To this advice the Kaiser added, on July 5, an essential dimension of active German\nsupport, telling the Austrian Ambassador to Germany, Count Szogyeny, that Russia was\n‘in no way prepared for war’ and that the Austrians would regret it if, having recognised\nthe necessity of war against Serbia, ‘we did not make use of the present moment, which\nis all in our favour’. The Kaiser added: ‘Should war between Austria-Hungary and Russia\nprove unavoidable’, Germany would be at Austria’s side.\nLater  that  day,  while  still  at  Potsdam,  the  Kaiser  told  the  German  Chancellor,\nBethmann-Hollweg, and the Prussian War Minister, General Falkenhayn, that he ‘did not\nbelieve that there was any prospect of great warlike developments. The Tsar would not\nside with the Archduke’s murderers, and Russia and France were not ready for war.’ For\nthis reason, the Kaiser explained, ‘there was no need to make special dispositions’. He","this reason, the Kaiser explained, ‘there was no need to make special dispositions’.

Anger  in  Vienna,\napprehension in Belgrade, and relaxation in Berlin, were the order of the day. With the\nKaiser’s departure on his cruise, the shock of Europe’s latest episode began to subside.\nIn Vienna, however, the secret debates on how to deal with Serbia continued. On July 7\nthe eight members of the Austro-Hungarian Cabinet met to discuss the Kaiser’s oʃer of\nwww.frenchpdf.com","German  help.  Berchtold,  who  presided,  proposed  an  immediate  attack  on  Serbia,\nwithout even a declaration of war.\nThe overriding mood of the meeting was for war, and for the reduction of Serbia in\nsize, making her dependent on Austria. Only Count Tisza protested to the Emperor,\nwriting to him on the following day that an Austrian attack on Serbia ‘would, in human\npossibility, provoke the world war’: a war that Tisza believed would bring not only\nRussia  but  also  Roumania  against  Austria-Hungary,  exposing  the  Empire  to  a  ‘very\nunfavourable’ prospect.\nThe  Germans  ignored  Tisza’s  worries.  When  the  German  Ambassador  in  Vienna,\nCount Tschirschky, went to see Berchtold, he emphasised the German desire for action\nagainst Serbia. ‘He told me’, Berchtold informed Tisza, ‘that he had received a telegram\nfrom Berlin according to which his Imperial Master instructed him to declare here with","from Berlin according to which his Imperial Master instructed him to declare here with\nall emphasis that in Berlin an action against Serbia is expected, and that it would not be\nunderstood in Germany if we allowed the opportunity to pass without striking a blow.’\nFears of Russia continued to inɻuence the Germans. On July 7 Bethmann-Hollweg had\ncommented: ‘The future lies with Russia, she grows and grows, and lies on us like a\nnightmare.’ On the following day he informed Prince Lichnowsky that ‘not only the\nextremists’ in Berlin ‘but even level-headed politicians are worried at the increases in\nRussian strength, and the imminence of Russian attack.’\n***\nOn July 8, ten days after the Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s assassination, a senior British\ngeneral,  Sir  Horace  Smith-Dorrien,  told  his  old  school  association  dinner  that  they\nshould  all  ɹt  themselves  ‘for  the  coming  struggle’.

He\nthen told the Ambassador that Britain had been ‘endeavouring to persuade the Russian\nGovernment  even  at  the  present  juncture  to  adopt  a  calm  view  and  a  conciliatory\nattitude towards Austria, should the Vienna Cabinet feel obliged in consequence of the","attitude towards Austria, should the Vienna Cabinet feel obliged in consequence of the\nSarajevo  murder  to  take  up  a  stern  attitude  towards  Serbia.’  However,  there  were\nmeasures, Grey warned, on which Austria might embark, ‘such as to arouse Slav feeling’,\nwhich  might  make  it  impossible  for  the  Russians  to  ‘remain  passive’.  What  these\nmeasures  might  be,  Grey  did  not  indicate.  That  very  day  his  principal  diplomatic\nadviser, Sir Arthur Nicolson, wrote with a certain conɹdence to the British Ambassador\nin Vienna: ‘I have my doubts as to whether Austria will take any action of a serious\ncharacter and I expect the storm will blow over.’\nThis optimistic view might have been conɹrmed on July 13, had Nicolson known of\na secret Austrian report which reached Vienna that day from Sarajevo, stating that there\nwww.frenchpdf.com","was no evidence to implicate the Serbian Government in the assassination. The Austrian\ndesire to punish Serbia was still strong, however, sustained by the feeling that Germany\nwould  support  punitive  action.  When  Berchtold  ɹnally  convinced  Franz  Josef  that\nAustria could chastise Serbia without any other powers taking Serbia’s side, the old man\nreluctantly agreed to an Austrian ultimatum. Berchtold’s successful persuasion was the\nfirst step towards war. Nicolson’s confidence had been misplaced.\nIn Vienna, the secret and public debate continued: should action be taken against\nSerbia? Nicolson’s optimistic comment had been written in answer to the warning by\none of his subordinates that ‘the unwisdom of a blindly anti-Serbian policy is not at all\nappreciated in Austria, and that is the real point in a rather threatening situation’.

On July 16, in a talk in London on the international situation, and the dangers of\na ‘grand military bonɹre’, Norman Angell told a largely socialist audience: ‘The younger\ngeneration are, I believe, increasingly determined not to be the victims of that supreme\nfutility.’\nEven  as  Norman  Angell  was  putting  his  faith  in  the  ‘younger  generation’,  the\nhesitations in Vienna among the older generation were ending. On July 14 the Austrian\nCouncil of Ministers had decided to deliver an ultimatum in a week’s time.

But all this was now in the past: under\nseal of secrecy, the senior authorities in Berlin were informed of the date on which the\nAustrian ultimatum to Serbia would be delivered, and made no protest. The German\narmy hierarchy was ready for war. On July 17 the Deputy Chief of the General Staʃ,\nGeneral  Waldersee,  wrote  to  the  Foreign  Secretary,  von  Jagow,  from  Berlin:  ‘I  shall\nremain here ready to jump; we are all prepared at the General Staff.’\nJagow, like the Kaiser, was conɹdent that Russia would not intervene.

Conrad  was  the\nkeenest  for  war,  and  determined  that  Austria  would  make  territorial  gains  on  the\nBosnian border as a result of it.\nOn July 21 Franz Josef agreed to the terms of the ultimatum, inɻuenced by the fact\nthat some groups inside Serbia had been involved in the plot, and by fears of the threat\nof  Serbian  expansion.  On  the  following  day  the  Russian  Foreign  Minister,  Sergius\nSazonoʃ, warned Austria against taking drastic action. This Russian warning came too\nlate, and lacked any threat of Russian military action.\nThe Austrian ultimatum had not yet been delivered. On July 23 the British Chancellor","The Austrian ultimatum had not yet been delivered.

There were those in Britain, however, who saw themselves detached\nfrom Europe. The Prime Minister, H.H. Asquith, told King George V that Europe was\n‘within  measurable  distance  of  a  real  Armaggedon’,  but  that  as  far  as  Britain  was\nconcerned, ‘Happily there seems to be no reason why we should be anything more than\nspectators.’ Britain’s First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, wrote to his wife","spectators.’ Britain’s First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, wrote to his wife\nthat  Europe  was  ‘trembling  on  the  verge  of  a  general  war’  and  that  the  Austrian\nultimatum was ‘the most insolent document of its kind ever devised’. From Berlin, the\nBritish Chargé d’Aʃaires, Sir Horace Rumbold, wrote to his wife: ‘In two hours from\nnow the time limit expires and the Austrians will probably be in Belgrade by Monday.\nThe Lord knows what will happen then and I tell you—between ourselves—that we\nshall be lucky if we get out of this without the long-dreaded European war, a general\nbust-up in fact.’\nSerbia  was  reluctant  to  agree  to  Austria’s  wide-ranging  demands,  but  even  more\nreluctant  also  to  provoke  an  attack  from  her  powerful  neighbour.  The  demands  of\nwww.frenchpdf.com","defence  and  survival  were  hard  to  reconcile.  The  Emperor  Franz  Josef  had  ordered\npartial Austrian mobilisation that day, yet the process was not to start for three days,\nand was so cumbersome that it would take sixteen days to complete.\nAt three o’clock on the afternoon of July 25 Serbia mobilised. Three hours later she\nreplied  to  the  ultimatum,  agreeing,  as  demanded  by  Austria,  that  anti-Austrian\npropagandists  would  be  punished,  and  that  subversive  movements  would  be\nsuppressed.  All  those  connected  with  the  Archduke’s  assassination  would,  as  also\ndemanded,  be  brought  to  justice.  As  to  Austria’s  insistence  on  participation  in  the\njudicial process inside Serbia, the most drastic point of the ten, Serbia asked only that\nthis demand be submitted to the International Tribunal at The Hague.\nHalf  an  hour  after  the  Serbian  reply  to  Austria,  which  was  judged  by  all  outside","Half  an  hour  after  the  Serbian  reply  to  Austria,  which  was  judged  by  all  outside\nobservers to be conciliatory, even humiliating, the Austrian Ambassador, Baron Giesl,\nleft Belgrade.

The Austrians\nrejected this. A British attempt that same day to convene a four-power conference of\nBritain, Germany, France and Italy ‘for the purpose of discovering an issue which would\nprevent complications’ was rejected by Germany on the grounds that such a conference\n‘was not practicable’.

He knew of no Minister who\nwww.frenchpdf.com","would be in favour of it.’ The meeting did agree, however, that the First and Second\nFleets, which by chance were concentrated at Portland in the English Channel, at the\nend of a practice mobilisation that had been agreed upon six months earlier, should not\nbe dispersed to their home ports. Realising that Britain might be drawn into a war by\nthe  alliance  systems,  Churchill  obtained  Asquith’s  approval  that  afternoon  to  set  up\nspecial  armed  guards  on  ammunition  and  oil  depots,  and  informed  all  naval\ncommanders:  ‘European  political  situation  makes  war  between  Triple  Alliance  and\nTriple Entente powers by no means impossible.

So keen was the German High Command\nto see Austria attack before the world could react that they urged Austria not to wait\neven until the completion of her mobilisation, which still needed almost two weeks.\nIn the ɹve days following the Austrian ultimatum, Britain took a lead among the\nEuropean states in pressing Austria not to attack Serbia. She also evolved a formula","European states in pressing Austria not to attack Serbia. She also evolved a formula\ndesigned to bring Austria and Russia together.

Taking charge of 1,500 men, he\npenetrated between the forts and entered the city. A day later, on August 7, the central\ncitadel surrendered; but the forts remained and it was necessary for the German troops\nto overcome them one by one, or be defeated by this obstacle to their advance, and to\ntheir plans.\n***\nHitherto, amid the vast armies of conscripts, ɹlled by national systems of compulsory\nmilitary service, the British alone had a purely professional army, small, highly trained,","military service, the British alone had a purely professional army, small, highly trained,\nbut lacking the numerical capacity of the European armies. On August 6 the British\nCabinet discussed whether this army, altogether only six divisions, should be sent to\nFrance  at  all.  The  Prime  Minister,  Asquith,  and  the  Foreign  Secretary,  Grey,  both\nexpressed concern about the vulnerability of Britain herself if the troops were sent to\nEurope.  Grey  in  particular  thought  that  the  Expeditionary  Force  should  remain  in\nBritain. At a meeting of the War Council that evening, Lord Kitchener, who shocked his\ncolleagues by suggesting that the war might prove to be a long one, insisted that two of\nthe six divisions should be kept in Britain for home defence. It was agreed that the\nremaining four should go to France. The British contribution to the European struggle,\nwww.frenchpdf.com","even at its greatest extent, could only be a small one: 50,000 men under arms at the\noutbreak of the war, compared with more than three million Austro-Hungarians, four\nmillion Frenchmen, four-and-a-half million Germans and nearly six million Russians.\nOne oʃer of troops was turned down by the British Government. On the outbreak of\nwar the Irish Nationalist leader, John Redmond, offered to form an Irish army to fight as\nan entirely Irish force alongside the English, Welsh and Scottish troops. Not wanting to\ndisturb the smooth working of his existing plans, Kitchener rejected this, ignoring the\nstrength of Irish national feeling that might have been channelled into such a force, and,\nas some Irishmen believed, away from rebellion and terrorism. In the event, 160,000\nIrishmen volunteered, and 49,000 were killed, in the ranks of the British Army.

On\nAugust  6,  the  day  before  Kitchener’s  appeal,  the  journal  of  the  Independent  Labour\nParty,  the Labour  Leader,  in  an  attempt  to  stimulate  anti-war  feeling,  exhorted  its\nreaders:  ‘Workers  of  Great  Britain,  down  with  war.

On\nAugust 7, in Vienna, the 25-year-old Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who\nhad just returned from teaching at Cambridge, volunteered as a gunner in the Austrian\narmy,  despite  a  double  hernia  that  entitled  him  to  exemption.  ‘At  ɹrst  he  only\nwww.frenchpdf.com","succeeded in going to Galicia with a military repair workshop,’ his sister Hermione later\nrecalled, ‘but he never ceased to worm his way towards the front line.’ There were, she\nsaid, many comic misunderstandings ‘which stemmed from the fact that the military\nauthorities, with whom he was always dealing, always assumed that he was looking for\nan easier post while he, on the contrary, was after a more dangerous one.’\n***\nIn every belligerent country the authorities arrested and imprisoned those whom they\nregarded  as  dangerous  enemy  aliens.  On  August  8,  in  the  West  Galician  town  of\nNeumarkt\n10\n, forty miles from the Russian border, the Austrian police arrested a Russian\nexile who had been living there for some years, Vladimir Lenin, fearing that he might\nbe a Russian spy.

Lenin  was\nreleased, and given permission to travel to neutral Switzerland.\nIn Germany Walther Rathenau, the industrialist who had been so despondent in the\nweek before war was declared, went on August 8 to see the Head of the General War\nDepartment in Berlin, Colonel Scheüch, to oʃer his support to the war eʃort. Pointing\nout that Germany only had a ‘limited number’ of months’ supply of indispensable war\nmaterials, Rathenau proposed ‘to save Germany from strangulation’, and within a few\ndays was put in charge of a specially-created War Raw Materials Department.

In  Russia  in  particular  the\nMenshevik  and  Bolshevik  factions  of  the  Russian  Social  Democrat  Party  were  both\nopposed to the war, and in the Russian Parliament, the Duma, voted against war credits.\nDespite an assurance on August 10 from the French Ambassador in Petrograd, Maurice\nPaléologue,  that  ‘the  collective  soul  of  Holy  Russia  has  never  manifested  itself  so\nforcibly since 1812’, the Entente powers were worried about the spread of anti-war\nfeeling  in  Russia.  On  August  11  the  Belgian  Government  prevailed  upon  its  newly\nappointed Minister of State, the socialist Emile Vandervelde, to send a telegram to the\nwww.frenchpdf.com","Russian Social Democrat deputies in the Duma, urging them to support the war eʃort.\nAs Chairman of the International Socialist Bureau, Vandervelde was much respected in\nRussia: that June he had been in St Petersburg trying to reconcile the diʃerent Russian\nsocialist factions.

On August 6 a small force of Polish riɻemen, from the\nAustrian  province  of  Galicia,  crossed  the  Russian  frontier  and  advanced  towards  the\ntown  of  Kielce.

Internal\nunrest of any sort would help them in the struggle against the vast Russian forces. That\nsame August 6 the Austrian Government decided to give money to the Union for the\nLiberation of the Ukraine, to encourage anti-Russian and separatist agitation. Armenian\nand Georgian socialists were also encouraged to see the defeat of the Tsar as the way\nforward to independence.\nA racial as well as a political element emerged rapidly in the ɹrst weeks of war. On\nAugust 11, in a mass meeting at the Town Hall in Berlin, Professor von Harnack, head\nof the Royal Library, spoke of the threat to western civilisation from ‘the civilisation of\nthe  Horde  that  is  gathered  and  kept  together  by  despots,  the  Mongolian  Muscovite","the  Horde  that  is  gathered  and  kept  together  by  despots,  the  Mongolian  Muscovite\ncivilisation.

Kress  then  asked,  if  British  warships  tried  to\nfollow the Germans, were they to be ɹred on? Again Enver said yes.

His  reserve\nregiment, moving forward three days after the oʃensive had begun, was being shelled\nby Russian artillery when the order came to attack. ‘On the right the young drummer\nwith his bloodshot feverish eyes, his quivering almost crying mouth and the pale lips,","with his bloodshot feverish eyes, his quivering almost crying mouth and the pale lips,\nno longer is he that young lad whose vigorous drumrolls brought us once more to our\ntired feet.

We run on with gasping\nbreath; dead and wounded lie all around and we look at them indifferently.’\nAs Feuchtinger’s regiment reached the Russian trenches, the Russians turned to ɻee.\nOne of them, being closely chased, and apparently without his riɻe, stopped all of a\nsudden,  turned  round,  held  out  his  right  hand,  and  put  his  left  hand  into  his  tunic\npocket. As he did so, Feuchtinger plunged in his bayonet. ‘I see his blood redden his\nuniform, hear him moan and groan as he twists with the bayonet in his young body. I\nam seized with terror.

Among the Austrians in this retreat was the violinist Fritz Kreisler. ‘For\ntwenty-one days,’ he later recalled, ‘I went without taking oʃ my clothes, sleeping on\nwet grass or in mud, or in the swamps.’ On one occasion there was a twenty-minute\ntruce  when,  after  shouts  across  No-Man’s  Land  an  unarmed  Russian,  meeting  an\nunarmed Austrian in the middle exchanged a packet of tobacco for a cigar.\nThe prospect of serving at the Front was a cause for distress among some who were\nwww.frenchpdf.com","called up. On August 30 the painter Oskar Kokoschka wrote to a friend from Vienna:\n‘These simple, starving, bewildered lads and men, who have had nothing but misery all\ntheir lives, are being driven to their deaths, or crippled, and nobody gives a tuppenny\ndamn about it afterwards.

Was the Belgian Army just a\npack of hares?’\nAt  French  headquarters  there  was  laughter  at  Kitchener’s  Order  of  the  Day  to  the\nBritish troops then on their way through France.

On August 17, when two Russian\narmies, one led by General Rennenkampf (of the German-sounding name), the other by\nGeneral Samsonov, began their advance into East Prussia. On a 35-mile front, Samsonov\nwas  challenged  by  the  commander  of  the  German  I  Corps  (the  confusingly  named\nGeneral François), who forced Samsonov to battle, against the orders of his superiors.\nDuring  the  battle,  at  Stalluponen,  François  took  3,000  Russian  prisoners  before\nretreating to a stronger position.\nDespite this German victory on German soil, it was clear to the General Staʃ that","Despite this German victory on German soil, it was clear to the General Staʃ that\ngrave danger threatened in East Prussia, which had been eʃectively denuded of troops\nto enable France to be defeated before the start of the invasion of Russia.

The German Commander-in-Chief in East\nPrussia, General Prittwitz, panicked. ‘I must withdraw to the Vistula,’ he told General\nFrançois on the telephone.

On October\n21, a German artilleryman, Herbert Sulzbach, who was in action for the ɹrst time, wrote\nin his diary: ‘We pull forward, get our ɹrst glimpse of this battleɹeld, and have to get\nused to the terrible scenes and impressions: corpses, corpses and more corpses, rubble,\nand the remains of villages.’\nwww.frenchpdf.com","German infantrymen had just captured the village of Premesque. ‘The bodies of friend\nand foe lie tumbled together’, Sulzbach wrote. ‘Heavy infantry ɹre drives us out of the\nposition which we had taken up, and this is added to by increasingly heavy British\nartillery ɹre.

At the hamlet of Kortekeer\nmore than seven hundred Germans were taken prisoner. With them were liberated ɹfty\nBritish soldiers who had been captured by the Germans at the start of the battle.\n***\nThe line of trenches was beginning to acquire a fatal, static logic of its own.

At Reutel, just north of the Menin Road, a battalion\nof the Wiltshire Regiment was all but wiped out on October 25, the few survivors being\ntaken prisoner.\nSouth of Ypres, Indian troops went into action for the ɹrst time on the Western Front\nwhen, on the night of October 25, between Wytschaete and Messines, they drove oʃ a\nGerman attack.

This minelaying, outside an enemy’s three-mile limit, was illegal under the\nSecond Hague Convention of 1907: it led on November 3 to a declaration, strongly\nadvocated  by  the  British  Prime  Minister,  that  the  whole  of  the  North  Sea  must  be\nregarded as a British ‘military area’ and that parts of it would be mined. Neutral ships\nwould enter the North Sea ‘at their own peril’. If they put in to British ports, where they\ncould  be  searched  for  any  supplies  on  their  way  to  Germany,  they  would  then  be\nescorted through the minefields, any ‘illegal’ cargo having first been removed.\nThe neutral States most aʃected by the blockade, Norway and Sweden, protested at\nthis  British  breach  of  international  law.

Whereas the German minelaying policy resulted in many hundreds of neutral ships\nbeing blown up, the British blockade was only dangerous to those ships which declined\nto put in to British ports. In two years, only ɹve American ships were sunk, and four\nAmerican  lives  lost,  as  a  result  of  American-registered  merchant  ships  refusing  to\ncomply with the British blockade.\n***\nOn  the  Eastern  Front,  German  troops  pressed  forward  inside  Russian  Poland,  and\nRussian troops pushed deeper into Austrian Galicia.

The fact that a quarter of a million Jews were\nserving in the Russian army did not help to combat prejudice. Hundreds of thousands of\nJews were driven from their homes in Lodz, Piotrkow, Bialystok and Grodno, and from\ndozens of other towns and villages. They took to the road, carrying what possessions\nthey  could  put  on  carts  or  into  bundles,  and  moved  eastwards,  eventually  ɹnding\nsanctuary deep inside Russia, far from the hysteria of the war zones.\nwww.frenchpdf.com","On the battleɹelds of the Eastern Front, the casualties were on an even greater scale\nthan in the west.

He also received a letter from a\nclose friend and fellow Member of Parliament, Valentine Fleming, who was serving on\nthe  Western  Front,  and  sought  to  describe  the  scene.  ‘First  and  most  impressive,’\nFleming wrote, ‘the absolutely indescribable ravages of modern artillery ɹre, not only\nupon all men, animals and buildings within its zone, but upon the very face of nature\nitself.

In these trenches, Fleming explained, ‘crouch lines of men, in\nbrown  or  grey  or  blue,  coated  with  mud,  unshaven  hollow-eyed  with  the  continual\nstrain, unable to reply to the everlasting run of shells hurled at them from three, four,\nɹve or more miles away and positively welcoming an infantry attack from one side or\nthe other as a chance of meeting and matching themselves against human assailants and\nnot against invisible, irresistible machines, the outcome of an ingenuity which even you","not against invisible, irresistible machines, the outcome of an ingenuity which even you\nand I would be in agreement in considering unproductive from every point of view’.\nFleming ended his letter: ‘It’s going to be a long war in spite of the fact that on both\nsides every single man in it wants it stopped at once.’\n48\nOn  November  23,  Churchill  sent  this  letter  to  his  wife  Clementine.  ‘What  would\nhappen I wonder,’ he asked, ‘if the armies suddenly & simultaneously went on strike\nand said some other method must be found of settling the dispute! Meanwhile however\nnew avalanches of men are preparing to mingle in the conɻict and it widens every\nhour.’ That evening, in the Ypres Salient, German troops broke into the trenches being\nheld by Indian troops at Festubert.

The action marked what a French\nmilitary spokesman called ‘the beginning of a new invasion of German territory’. But no\nterritorial  gains  were  made.  Further  west,  French  civilians  were  evacuated  from  the\nvillage  of  Sampigny  for  fear  that  the  Germans  might  try  to  destroy  the  house  of\nPresident Poincaré there, or even capture the President if he were to visit the village.\nThey did succeed in destroying the house, Le Clos, and much of the town, using the\nlong-distance heavy Austrian siege guns that had been so eʃective in August against the\nBelgian forts.","Belgian forts.\nElsewhere  on  the  French  sector  of  the  Western  Front,  among  the  French  Foreign\nLegion volunteers ɹghting that month was the American, William Thaw. ‘Wish I were\nback dodging street cars on Broadway for excitement,’ he wrote home on November 27.\n‘Am that tired of being shot at!’ He had already been hit ‘in the cap and bayonet’ and\nhad not washed ‘for twenty days’.\nThe  British  troops  in  the  Ypres  Salient  were  now  instructed  by  Joʃre  to  make  a\nlimited attack on the German trenches.

One of those soldiers\nwas Hitler, who on December 2 received his Iron Cross.

In the British sector, 20,000 men were invalided during the winter\non  account  of  ‘trench  feet’  alone.  The  British  Commander-in-Chief,  Sir  John  French,\nfound the ground ‘only a quagmire’ when he visited it on December 10. ‘In that part of\nthe world,’ General Smith-Dorrien later recalled, ‘there appeared to be no stones or\ngravel, and rain converted the soil into a sort of liquid mud of the consistency of thick","gravel, and rain converted the soil into a sort of liquid mud of the consistency of thick\nporridge without the valuable sustaining quality of that excellent Scots mixture.

During\nthe attack on Givenchy on December 18, a group of Highlanders adjacent to the Indian\nCorps were unable to ɹre, because most of their riɻes had become clogged with mud,\nand were then captured by the Germans. That day, in the part of the line held by a\nbattalion  of  Scots  Guards,  an  attack  on  the  German  trenches  in  what  their  oɽcial\nhistorian, C.T. Atkinson, called ‘a not very happily conceived enterprise’ led to half the\nbattalion  being  killed  or  wounded.  The  orders  for  the  attack,  Atkinson  commented,\nshowed ‘an optimism which did not indicate any close acquaintance either with the\nstate of the ground or with the general conditions of the front line, or any very accurate\nappreciation of the diɽculties of attacking entrenched positions defended by modern\nriɻes and machine-guns and protected by belts of barbed wire’.

Other dangers were posed by\nthe  weather.  The  Oɽcial  History  of  the  Indian  Corps  in  France  commented:  ‘The\nelements were warring on the side of the enemy, for torrential rain during the night had\nmade  the  trenches  almost  untenable.

A German soldier’s diary, found by the French, was passed on to the British\nand reproduced in the daily bulletin of the First Army. ‘The sight of the trenches and the\nfury, not to say bestiality, of our men,’ this German soldier had written on December 19,\n‘in beating to death the wounded English aʃected me so much that, for the rest of the\nday, I was ɹt for nothing.’ Within a few days of the failure of the attack of December 18\non Givenchy by the Scots Guards, there was anger in the British lines when news spread\nof how a wounded British soldier, crawling painfully back, was then shot twice in the\nthighs by the Germans, and then deliberately killed, as he reached the British parapet.","thighs by the Germans, and then deliberately killed, as he reached the British parapet.\nThe daily incidents of trench warfare could be extremely cruel.

Both  of  them  had\ngangrene. One of them had gone mad. On the following day, after an attack by the\nLiverpool Scottish Regiment, the Colour Sergeant, R.A.

The British gave the German\nsoldiers plum puddings ‘which they much appreciated’. Then arrangements were made\nbetween  the  two  sides  to  bury  the  British  dead  who  had  been  killed  during  the\ndisastrous raid on the night of December 18, and whose bodies were still lying between\nthe lines, mostly at the edge of the German front-line wire where they had been shot","the lines, mostly at the edge of the German front-line wire where they had been shot\ndown. ‘The Germans brought the bodies to a half way line and we buried them,’ Hulse\nwrote in the battalion diary. ‘Detachments of British and Germans formed a line and a\nGerman and English Chaplain read some prayers alternately. The whole of this was\ndone in great solemnity and reverence.’\nThat Christmas Day, fraternisation between the Germans and their enemies took place\nalmost  everywhere  in  the  British  No-Man’s  Land,  and  at  places  in  the  French  and\nBelgian lines. It was almost always initiated by German troops, through either messages\nor song. Near Ploegsteert a German-speaking British oɽcer, Captain R.J.

Other  British\nsoldiers joined with their fellow German infantrymen in chasing hares. Some kicked a\nfootball about in No-Man’s Land. One British oɽcer, 2nd Lieutenant R.D. Gillespie, was\ntaken into the German lines and shown a board which had been put up to honour a\nBritish officer who, in an earlier attack, had reached that trench before being killed.\nBruce Bairnsfather, whose book of trench tales, Bullets & Billets, was among the most\nwww.frenchpdf.com","popular British wartime volumes, recalled going into No-Man’s Land on Christmas Day\nto join ‘the throng about half-way across to the German trenches.

In answer to the Christian\npaciɹsts  of  Cambridge,  one  of  Oxford’s  leading  classicists,  Alfred  Zimmern,  wrote\nscathingly in the introduction to a book of essays linking the Allied war eʃort with the\nwww.frenchpdf.com","struggle  to  uphold  democracy:  ‘Those  who  hold  that  Christianity  and  war  are\nincompatible would seem to be committed to a monastic and passively anarchist view\nof  life,  inconsistent  with  membership  in  a  political  society.’  The  leading  clergy  of\nEurope supported the war and blessed the soldiers going to it. On December 26 an Irish\npoet, Katharine Tynan, published a poem in the Spectator, subsequently much quoted\nby the Bishop of London, A. Winnington-Ingram, in which death on the battlefield had a\ndivine motivator:\nLest heaven be thronged with grey-beards hoary,\nGod, who made boys for His delight,\nStoops in a day of grief and glory\nAnd calls them in, in from the night.\nGod ‘calls them in’: on the Caucasian front two diʃerent faces of God were in conɻict as\nRussian Christian and Turkish Muslim troops faced each other in a bitter struggle in the\nmountain passes of eastern Turkey.

At Sarikamis, the Russians were forcing the Turks back, but their need\nfor a diversion, though no longer acute, was still urgent. Russian troops from Siberia,\nwho might have tilted the balance in the Caucasus, were needed for the defence of\nWarsaw. British help for the Russians could be provided without taking a single soldier\nfrom the Western Front.\nWithin the British War Council, it was the stalemate on the Western Front that oʃered\nanother reason for an attack on Turkey, assuming that such an attack could lead to a\nswift victory. ‘Are there not other alternatives than sending our armies to chew barbed\nwire in Flanders?’ Churchill asked Asquith on December 29. Three days later Lloyd\nGeorge expressed the same view when he urged ‘bringing Germany down by knocking\nthe props from under her’. Lloyd George suggested that some action might be taken","the props from under her’. Lloyd George suggested that some action might be taken\nagainst  Austria-Hungary,  perhaps  a  landing  somewhere  along  the  Dalmatian  coast.\nWithin a few weeks, after considerable discussion, the British War Council, headed by\nAsquith, decided that Turkey was to be the prop that would be knocked down. ‘Steps\nwill  be  taken  to  make  a  demonstration  against  the  Turks,’  Kitchener  informed  the\nRussian Government on the second day of 1915.\n***\nAnother  war  zone  was  about  to  be  created.  The  capacity  to  kill  and  destroy  was\nwww.frenchpdf.com","spreading. Hundreds of towns and villages that had known many decades of tranquillity,\nsome even centuries of tranquillity, had become the meeting points of armies and the\nscenes  of  devastation  and  pain.  ‘A  huge,  cumbrous  mechanism  had  cast  a  blight  of\nparalysis on human endeavour,’ one of the war’s historians, John Buchan, has written.\n‘The fronts had been stricken by their vastness into stagnation. Already a man could\nwalk by a chain of outposts from Switzerland to the Vosges, and in a ditch from the\nVosges to the North Sea.’\n51\nEach corps, regimental and regional history told the same story of peril and failure\nthat December. The historian of the London County Council war eʃort, Vincent Weeks,\nhimself later a veteran of ɹfteen months on the Western Front, described trench warfare\nat this time ‘with its mud and slime and vermin, with its patrols in No-Man’s Land, with\nits  nightly  ration  parties.

They had served, in civilian life, in the\ntramways, parks, education and asylums departments. Arthur James Webb had worked\nas an orderly at the Bexley Mental Hospital. A private in the Grenadier Guards since\nAugust, he was killed in action on 29 December 1914 near La Bassée, not far from a\nFrench mental hospital. He was one of the last fatalities of 1914. That day Churchill\nwrote to Asquith: ‘When Kitchener declared that there was nothing in front of us but\n“boys and old men”, he was wrong; and when you and I agreed there was a ɹne and","“boys and old men”, he was wrong; and when you and I agreed there was a ɹne and\nterrible army in our front, we were right.

The reader far from the war zone could only glimpse at\nreality, gain a certain impression, pick up a certain mood or image. Among those whose\nnotes from the front were published during the war was a French interpreter with the\nBritish forces, Captain Philippe Millet, who had been wounded at Charleroi in August\n1914.  In  his  book  he  recalled  a  conversation  with  a  British  soldier  that  December.\n‘Twenty-two  days  in  the  trenches,  sir—yes, twenty-two.  The  regiment  has  lost  ɹve\nhundred men.

On December 3\nthe Japanese Government, which was ɹghting the Germans in the remote islands and\nports of the Paciɹc Ocean, obtained a promise from Britain that Japan could occupy all\nGerman  territory  north  of  the  Equator.  This  agreement  caused  much  anger  to  the\nAustralian Government, which had hoped to acquire these large colonial possessions for\nAustralia.

On the Serbian\nFront at the beginning of 1915, typhus struck the soldiers in both the  Austrian  and\nSerbian Armies. As a gesture of support for Serbia, British women volunteers took more\nthan a hundred tons of hospital stores and medicine to Serbia.

Russia’s\ncontrol of Galicia was all but over. A British observer with the Russian Third Army\nwrote: ‘This army is now a harmless mob.’\nAt Gallipoli, in an oʃensive launched on June 4, the Anglo-French forces tried for a\nthird time to reach the hill of Achi Baba. More than 30,000 British and French troops\ntook part in the attack. At one point the Turks had built a dummy trench. The British\nbombarded it, then the men advanced, only to ɹnd that the real trench beyond was\nintact and fully manned. Nevertheless, at heavy loss, they captured it, driving the Turks\nout and capturing six Turkish machine guns. Then they were shelled, deliberately by the\nTurks and accidentally by their own artillery, which had at last discovered the error of\nthe dummy trench. Seeking to escape this double bombardment, the men abandoned\ntheir guns and returned, under continual Turkish ɹre, to their own lines.

If the others see that, they will all retire and\nrun as far as Constantinople.’ This was the opportunity for the British General, Aylmer\nHunter-Weston, to exploit the Turkish weakness, but he decided instead to send his\nreserves to that sector of the line where the French had failed to push the Turks back,\nand where a battalion of the Royal Naval Division had almost been destroyed. ‘It was a\nhard decision, and a wrong one,’ one historian has written.\n73\n As a result of it, the men","hard decision, and a wrong one,’ one historian has written.\n73\n As a result of it, the men\nwho had advanced almost to Krithia had to fall back, and accept new positions only five\nhundred yards in front of their starting-off trenches of the morning.\nBetween 250 and 500 yards of Turkish-held trenches were captured that day, on a\nmile-long front, but Achi Baba remained well behind the Turkish lines. To bring the\nBritish and French wounded back to the beaches for evacuation that day was an arduous\ntask, under continual Turkish sniping and artillery ɹre. ‘As I made my way along the\ntrench,’ a member of the Royal Naval Division, Chief Petty Oɽcer Johnston, wrote in\nhis diary, ‘I passed many heaps of dead upon which the great ugly ɻies were feasting.\nWounded by the dozen were huddled in side trenches waiting for the time when it\nwould be possible to get stretchers along to convey them to the base.’ Indian mule-cart","would be possible to get stretchers along to convey them to the base.’ Indian mule-cart\ndrivers, and men of the Zion Mule Corps, after bringing ammunition from the beaches\nto the trenches, would return with a new cargo, the wounded.\nAs for the dead, the need to consolidate the new positions meant that there was at\nɹrst no time for burials. On the front of one Scottish regiment, the Scottish Borderers,\nwrites  the  oɽcial  British  historian,  the  dead  ‘were  piled  up  on  each  side  of  the\ncommunication trench to the captured position, where they made a ghastly avenue. By\nan unfortunate mistake in psychology a Territorial battalion of the Scottish Borderers,\narriving shortly afterwards on the peninsula, had to bury these corpses as their ɹrst task\non shore.

This sailor, Leading Seaman Peters, when being\nled back through the British trenches, had broken free, and then rushed forward in the\nconfusion to the front line.

To come to Russia’s aid,\nKitchener told Haig, Britain and France must both ‘act vigorously’ on the Western Front.\nJust as the Russian appeal for help at the very end of 1914 had been a catalyst for the\nAnglo-French attack at the Dardanelles at the beginning of 1915, so the Russian losses\non the Eastern Front that August were to be the catalyst for a new oʃensive in the west.\nKitchener told Haig, who underlined his words in his diary that day, that ‘we must act\nwith all our energy, and do our utmost to help the French, even though, by doing so, we\nsuffered very heavy losses indeed’.\nwww.frenchpdf.com","The  continuing  Russian  losses  in  the  east,  culminating  on  August  19  with  the\nsurrender of 90,000 oɽcers and men at Novo-Georgievsk, made Kitchener’s call for a\nrenewed  oʃensive  in  the  west  seem  all  the  more  justiɹed,  and  urgent.

Opinions diʃered: Bonar Law answered that it would be in ‘about ɹve months’,\nbut Churchill believed it would not be until ‘the middle of the following year’. Despite\nthis warning, the conference decided that the oʃensive, on which Kitchener was set,\nwould go ahead.\n***\nWar  strategies  were  sustained  both  by  practical  necessity  on  the  battleɹeld,  and  by\npatriotic fervour at home. This was true in all the belligerent lands. ‘I must confess that I\nam bitterly disappointed at the narrow nationalist bias to be found even among men of\ngreat stature,’ Einstein wrote that August from Berlin to a fellow physicist in Holland.\n‘If, in addition, one recognises that those who are well informed and possess the power","‘If, in addition, one recognises that those who are well informed and possess the power\nto  act  lack  human  compassion,  it  becomes  apparent  how  sad  is  the  thing  that  is\nworshipped as the “fatherland”.

Some\nof the wounded were very cheerful.

Each\nadvancing column was estimated at more than a thousand men, ‘offering such a target as\nhad never been seen before, or thought possible.

The  German  regimental  account  continued:  ‘The\nmen stood on the ɹre-steps, some even on the parapets, and ɹred triumphantly into the\nmass of men advancing across open grass-land. As the entire ɹeld of ɹre was covered\nwith  the  enemy’s  infantry  the  eʃect  was  devastating  and  they  could  be  seen  falling\nliterally in hundreds.’ Further south, as the British troops approached the Bois Hugo, a\nsimilar  slaughter  was  taking  place.

Fourteen years later, Robert Graves, who was just twenty at the time of\nthe battle, gave an account in his book Goodbye to All That of one episode, and of one\noɽcer’s story: ‘When his platoon had run about twenty yards he signalled them to lie\ndown and open covering ɹre.

Near the Bois Hugo,\nwhen the ɹfth British attempt to push past the wood had failed, and when wounded\nmen began to work their way back to the British lines, one German regimental diary\ncommented: ‘No shot was ɹred at them from the German trenches for the rest of the\nday,  so  great  was  the  feeling  of  compassion  and  mercy  for  the  enemy  after  such  a\nvictory.’\nAfter that ɹfth attempt to push past the Bois Hugo, the attack was called oʃ. Among\nthe officers reported ‘missing’ after he had been caught by German machine-gun fire and\nshellɹre from the wood was Second Lieutenant John Kipling, the only son of Rudyard\nKipling.

For the British, Loos was a set-back that caused much heartsearching and\ndistress. Of nearly 10,000 British soldiers who attacked at Loos, 385 oɽcers and 7,861\nmen were killed or wounded.

On October 8,\nafter a visit to Sir John French’s headquarters, Haig noted in his diary: ‘Some of the\nwounded  had  gone  home  and  said  that  they  had  been  given  impossible  tasks  to\naccomplish and that they had not been fed.’\nDuring  and  after  the  Battle  of  Loos,  Captain  W.

In a French counter-attack,\nhowever, mostly with grenades, the Germans were driven back.\n93\nThe ɹghting in Champagne was severe: in the region of La Courtine and Massiges,\nwithin a radius of only ɹve miles, ɹve villages were totally destroyed: Hurlus, Perthes-\nles-Hurlus,  Le  Mesnil-les-Hurlus,  Tahure  and  Ripont.

A million pounds sterling had\nbeen borrowed in the second week of war. That sum had reached £50 million, with a\nfurther £100 million promised. Bark wanted even more, but President Poincaré was not\nhelpful. ‘I could remind Mr Bark’, the protocol of their discussion read, ‘that neither the\ntext nor the spirit of our alliance led us to foresee that Russia would ask us at some time\nto lend our credit.’ Bark produced his trump card: not gold reserves or the collateral of\nraw materials, but the threat that Russia would be unable to continue the war without\nFrench  economic  assistance.

In a letter sent to the Sherif from Sir Henry McMahon, Britain\nagreed ‘to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories\nincluded in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca’. These included\nMesopotamia and much of Syria. They excluded, at McMahon’s insistence, ‘portions of\nSyria lying west of the districts of Damascus, Hama, Homs and Aleppo’. Whether or not\nthey excluded Palestine was to be a matter of subsequent dispute, since that was not\nmentioned in the exchange of letters.

A week later\nMcMahon wrote again to Hussein to inform him that the latest Arab request, for neither\nAleppo nor Beirut to be excluded from the area of future Arab independence, would\nhave to be taken up with the French. As for the part the Arabs must play in the future,\n‘it is most essential’, McMahon wrote, ‘that you spare no eʃort to attach all the Arab\npeople to our united cause and urge them to aʃord no assistance to our enemies.

These\ndistant failures were to prove a strong deterrent to further distant campaigns, putting oʃ\nthe time when an Arab revolt against the Turks would become an integral part of Allied\nwar strategy. The Arabs in 1916, like the Italians and Bulgarians in 1915, wanted to see\nsome prospect of victory and territorial gain before committing themselves to battle. For\nthe British, the frustrations of each of the set-backs of 1915 were considerable, with\nGallipoli  and  Mesopotamia  the  most  depressing.  On  December  20,  Lloyd  George\nexpressed these feelings when he spoke in the House of Commons: ‘Too late in moving\nhere, too late in arriving there.

The British Government did\nnot want it, however, to continue in the Balkans. On December 4, at a conference in\nCalais,  the  British,  led  by  Asquith,  insisted  that  the  Allied  forces  at  Salonica  should\nwithdraw. Now that Serbia was defeated they could serve no purpose there. The French\nbowed to this logic. But two days later, at a further inter-Allied conference, this time at\nChantilly, the Russians, Italians and Serbs prevailed upon the French to agree to keep\nthe  Salonica  Front  open.

Their aim was to cause\npanic and a mass retreat. But the British troops, who had been surprised by the new\nweapon  in  April,  were  now  well  trained  in  gas  drill  and  well  equipped  with  gas\nhelmets.

They slept in soaking clothes, with boots full of\nwater, and they drank rain with their tea, and ate mud with their “bully”, and endured\nwww.frenchpdf.com","it all with the philosophy of “grin and bear it!” and laughter, as I heard them laughing\nin those places, between explosive curses.’ Hardly had the trenches been drained after\none rain storm than another undid the work ‘and the parapets slid down, and water\npoured in; and spaces were opened for German gun-ɹre, and there was less head cover\nagainst shrapnel bullets which mixed with the rain drops and high explosives which\nsmashed through the mud’.\nDuring November the rain was so intense that many trenches were knee high, and\neven  waist  high  in  water.  Gibbs  recalled  how,  in  one  sector  of  the  front,  ‘reckless\nbecause of their discomfort, the Germans crawled upon their slimy parapets and sat on\ntop to dry their legs, and shouted, “Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!” Our men did not shoot.\nThey, too, sat on the parapets drying their legs, and grinning at the grey ants yonder\nuntil these incidents were reported back to GHQ—where good ɹres were burning under","until these incidents were reported back to GHQ—where good ɹres were burning under\ndry  roofs—and  stringent  orders  came  against  “fraternisation”.  Every  German  who\nshowed himself—owing to a parapet falling in—would be shot too. It was six of one\nand half a dozen of the other, as always, in this trench warfare, but the dignity of GHQ\nwould  not  be  outraged  by  the  thought  of  such  indecent  spectacles  as  British  and\nGermans  refusing  to  kill  each  other  on  sight.  Some  of  the  men  obeyed  orders,  and\nwhere a German sat up and said, “Don’t shoot!” plugged him through the head. Others\nwere extremely short-sighted... Now and again Germans crawled over to our trenches\nand asked meekly to be taken prisoner.’\nAn episode took place that winter that was spoken of throughout the Western Front.\nAbove a German parapet, Gibbs has narrated, ‘appeared a plank on which in big letters\nwas scrawled these words: “The English are fools.” “Not such bloody fools as all that!”","was scrawled these words: “The English are fools.” “Not such bloody fools as all that!”\nsaid a sergeant, and in a few minutes the plank was smashed to splinters by riɻe-ɹre.\nAnother plank appeared with the words: “The French are fools.” Loyalty to our Allies\ncaused the destruction of that board. A third plank was put up. “We’re all fools. Let’s all\ngo home.” That board was also shot to pieces, but the message caused some laughter,\nand men repeating it said, “There’s a deal of truth in those words. Why should this go\non?

We\nall want to go home, to our wives and our work.” But neither side was prepared to “go\nhome” first. Each side was in a trap—a devil’s trap from which there was no escape.’\nIn his book, Gibbs described that ‘devil’s trap’ as follows: ‘Loyalty to their own side,","In his book, Gibbs described that ‘devil’s trap’ as follows: ‘Loyalty to their own side,\ndiscipline, with the death penalty behind it, spell words of old tradition, obedience to\nthe  laws  of  war,  or  to  the  caste  which  ruled  them,  all  the  moral  and  spiritual\npropaganda  handed  out  by  pastors,  newspapers,  generals,  staʃ  oɽcers,  old  men  at\nhome,  exalted  women,  female  furies,  a  deep  and  simple  love  for  England,  and\nGermany, pride of manhood, fear of cowardice—a thousand complexities of thought\nand sentiment prevented men, on both sides, from breaking the net of fate in which\nthey were entangled, and revolting against that mutual, unceasing massacre, by a rising\nfrom the trenches with a shout of, “We’re all fools!... Let’s all go home!”’\n***\nA particular source of agony that winter, adding to the torment of lice and rats, was\nwww.frenchpdf.com","‘trench foot’. ‘Men standing in slime for days and nights in ɹeld boots or puttees lost all\nsense of feeling in their feet,’ Gibbs wrote. ‘These feet of theirs, so cold and wet, began\nto swell, and then go “dead” and then suddenly to burn as though touched by red hot\npokers.  When  the  “reliefs”  went  up  scores  of  men  could  not  walk  back  from  the\ntrenches, but had to crawl, or to be carried pick-a-back by their comrades. So I saw\nhundreds of them, and as the winter dragged on, thousands.’ Battalions lost more men\nfrom the ɹghting line from trench foot than from wounds. ‘Brigadiers and Divisional\nGenerals were gloomy, and cursed the new aʀiction of their men. Some of them said it\nwas  due  to  damned  carelessness,  others  were  inclined  to  think  it  due  to  deliberate\nmalingering at a time when there were many cases of self-inɻicted wounds by men who\nshot their ɹngers away, or their toes, to get out of the trenches.

The  pain  was  martyrizing  like  that  of  men  tied  to  burning\nfaggots for conscience’ sake. In one battalion of the 49th (West Riding) Division there\nwere over 400 cases in that winter of 1915.’\nA cure was eventually found: rubbing feet with oil two or three times a day. But\nwhile the malady lasted it wreaked havoc with the ɹghting strength of the battalions.\nNevertheless, Gibbs wrote, ‘The spirit of the men fought against all that misery, resisted\nit, and would not be beaten by it.’\n***\nThe Christmas Truce that had broken out so spontaneously on the Western Front in\n1914 was not repeated in 1915. ‘Nothing of the kind is to be allowed on the Divisional","1914 was not repeated in 1915. ‘Nothing of the kind is to be allowed on the Divisional\nfront this year,’ one British Infantry Brigade was informed ɹve days before the festive\nseason  was  to  begin.  ‘The  Artillery  will  maintain  a  slow  gun  ɹre  on  the  enemy’s\ntrenches commencing at dawn, and every opportunity will as usual be taken to inɻict\ncasualties upon any of the enemy exposing themselves.’\nThese orders were, in the main, obeyed. The historian Lyn Macdonald has written of\nhow  ‘in  the  trenches  close  to  Plugstreet  Wood  a  tremendous  voice  entertained  the\ntrenches of both sides with a selection from La Traviata, stopping abruptly in mid-aria as\nif a door had been slammed shut’. Near Wulverghem the Germans set up a tree on the\nparapet of their front trench on Christmas Eve, ablaze with candles. ‘For a few moments\nthe  tiny  pinpoints  of  ɻame  ɻickered  uncertainly  in  the  dark  until  a  British  oɽcer\nordered rapid fire and the Tommies shot it down.’\n99","ordered rapid fire and the Tommies shot it down.’\n99\nChristmas Day was no diʃerent. ‘We hailed the smiling morn with ɹve rounds ɹred\nfast, and we kept up slow ɹre all day,’ Corporal D.A.

Yet\nthe nature of confrontation was such that the British in the Ypres Salient were emphatic\nthat they had secured a great victory by holding Ypres at all. The town itself, regularly\nshelled by the Germans, was a ruin, but that too could be shown to have its virtuous\naspect.\n‘Only the methodical and painstaking Boche could have reduced a town of such size\nwww.frenchpdf.com","to such a state,’ commented Ian Hay, himself a soldier and one of the most popular\nBritish writers on the war. ‘But—the main point to observe is this.

That ‘unpleasantness’,\nhowever, had hardly any place in Hay’s narrative. The dead in his account had ‘gone to\nthe happy hunting-grounds’.\nWhat was clear, as 1915 came to an end, was that a mood of greater resignation\nprevailed than six months earlier. ‘We no longer regard War with the least enthusiasm,’\nHay wrote. ‘We have seen It, face to face. Our sole purpose now is to screw our sturdy\nfollowers up to the requisite pitch of eɽciency, and keep them remorselessly at that\nstandard until the dawn of triumphant and abiding peace.’ An experienced writer could\nstill  deploy  the  words  and  concepts  ‘eɽciency’,  ‘standard’  and  ‘triumphant’.

South of the Somme, the French made greater progress, so\nmuch so that a German general’s order that day stated directly: ‘I forbid the voluntary\nevacuation of trenches.’ But by nightfall on July 4 the French had taken 4,000 Germans\nprisoner and broken through the German line on a six-mile front.\nAmong the troops sent forward on the following day were detachments of the Foreign","Among the troops sent forward on the following day were detachments of the Foreign\nLegion. In their ranks were several dozen Americans, including the Harvard graduate,\nand  poet,  Alan  Seeger  (Legionnaire  No. 19522). He was with a unit led by a Swiss\nbaron, Captain de Tscharner, in an attack on the strongly fortiɹed village of Belloy-en-\nSanterre. During the attack they were caught in the enɹlade ɹre of six German machine\nguns. Lying mortally wounded in a shell-hole, Seeger was heard crying out for water,\nand for his mother. In his poem ‘Rendezvous’ he had written earlier that year:\nI have a rendezvous with Death\nOn some scarred slope or battered hill,\nWhen Spring comes round again this year\nAnd the first meadow-flowers appear.\nGod knows ’twere better to be deep\nPillowed in silk and scented down,\nWhere love throbs out in blissful sleep,\nPulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath,\nWhere hushed awakenings are dear....\nBut I’ve a rendezvous with Death\nAt midnight in some flaming town,","But I’ve a rendezvous with Death\nAt midnight in some flaming town,\nWhen Spring trips north again this year,\nAnd I to my pledged word am true,\nI shall not fail that rendezvous.\nBy nightfall Belloy-en-Santerre was in the Legion’s hands, but twenty-ɹve oɽcers and\n844 men had been killed or seriously wounded, a third of the attackers’ total strength.\nGoing forward on July 4 along a former German communication trench, Siegfried\nSassoon passed ‘three very badly-mangled corpses lying in it: a man, short, plump, with\nturned-up moustaches, lying face downward and half sideways with one arm ɻung up\nas if defending his head, and a bullet through his forehead. A doll-like ɹgure.

Vera  Brittain,  at  a  hospital  in  Camberwell,  later  recalled  ‘the  immense\nconvoys  which  came  without  cessation  for  about  a  fortnight,  and  continued  at  short\nintervals for the whole of that sultry month and the ɹrst part of August’. The distance\nfrom the battleɹeld was no protection against extreme distress. ‘Day after day I had to\nɹght the queer, frightening sensation—to which, throughout my years of nursing, I never\nbecame  accustomed—of  seeing  the  covered  stretchers  come  in,  one  after  another,","became  accustomed—of  seeing  the  covered  stretchers  come  in,  one  after  another,\nwithout knowing, until I ran with pounding heart to look, what fearful sight or sound or\nstench,  what  problem  of  agony  or  imminent  death,  each  brown  blanket  concealed.’\nAmong the wounded who reached Vera Brittain’s hospital was, by complete chance, her\nbrother Edward. He was to remain in England, and in intense pain, for many months.\nThe battle on the Somme became a daily struggle for small woods and even smaller\nvillages. On July 6, the village of La Boiselle was captured. The village of Contalmaison,\ncaptured by the British on the morning of July 7, was lost that evening. That same day,\na British attack on Mametz Wood was driven off.

Hugh\nBoustead later recalled the moment when he and his men were caught in a German\nshell barrage. ‘Although a shell pitched practically in the middle of the section,’ he later\nrecalled, ‘the three of us in the centre escaped any hurt other than a tremendous shock\nand blast which blew the equipment oʃ our shoulders, our steel hats away, and poured\ntear gas in great clouds all over the trench. Coughing and spitting and weeping and\nblinded  by  the  tear  gas  we  could  hear  those  of  our  comrades  who  were  wounded\nmoaning under the debris. Six of the section, three on either side of us, were utterly\ndestroyed, torn to pieces, and six more were wounded.’\nOn the Somme, as in each of the great battles where artillery tore up the bodies and\nthen  the  corpses  of  the  dead,  proper  identiɹcation  was  impossible  for  hundreds  of","then  the  corpses  of  the  dead,  proper  identiɹcation  was  impossible  for  hundreds  of\nthousands, those who are recorded on the monuments of these battles as having ‘no\nwww.frenchpdf.com","known grave’. Four years after the Battle of the Somme, Boustead received a letter from\nthe War Oɽce in London ‘asking if I could throw any light on the grave of Number\n5100, Private Hugh Boustead of the South African Scottish, the cross of which had been\nerected in Montauban valley in 1916 during the Somme Battle’. He was able to assure\nthe authorities that he was alive and well.\nAfter nine days of battle, the Germans had been pushed back a mile in some places,\nnearly  two  miles  in  others.  On  July  10  the  British  recaptured  what  was  left  of\nContalmaison village. That night, at Verdun, the Germans launched their ɹnal attempt\nto break through the French defences, take Fort Souville, and reach the city. As on June\n23, the attack began with shelling with Green Cross gas shells.

Thirty-three of its oɽcers and 1,300 men\nwere either killed or captured.\nBy  nightfall,  2,400  French  soldiers  had  been  taken  prisoner,  and  Fort  Souville’s\ngarrison knocked out by artillery ɹre. On the following day a small group of German\nsoldiers, no more than thirty, reached the outer wall of the fort and raised their ɻag.\nJust over two miles away they could see the twin towers of Verdun cathedral. Sheltering\nin the fort were sixty French soldiers, and a lieutenant, Kléber Dupuy. Leading his men\nout of the fort, Dupuy regained the walls, taking ten of the Germans prisoner.

The number of Germans captured had risen to more than 7,000. A further\n2,000 prisoners were taken during a push through the German lines on July 14, when\nboth  Longueval  and  Bazentin  were  captured,  and  Trônes  Wood  was  secured  for  the\nsecond  time.  In  an  eʃort  to  use  this  success  to  demoralise  the  Germans,  a  British\naeroplane was ordered to ɻy over the front line and to radio back, in a message that it\nwas  known  the  Germans  would  intercept:  ‘Enemy  second  line  of  defence  has  been\ncaptured on a front of 6,000 yards. British cavalry is now passing through in pursuit of\nthe demoralised enemy.’ Comments the oɽcial Royal Air Force historian, H.A.

Stallibrass, noted in his log book that day: ‘A large force of\nHun infantry were entrenched in a road running S.S.E. from High Wood. Fortunately a\nBritish aeroplane from No. 3 Squadron spotted the infantry and descended to 500 feet\nand flew up and down the line strafing them with a Lewis gun.’\nOn July 15, the ɹght for Delville Wood began, the ɹrst of ɹfteen days’ hand-to-hand\nɹghting and ferocious artillery bombardments. The battle started when the 3,000 strong\nSouth African Brigade, of which Hugh Boustead was a part, was ordered to capture the\nwood. ‘We moved forward through an orchard in single ɹle, led by the platoon oɽcer,’\nwww.frenchpdf.com","he later recalled. ‘Smith, the Second Lieutenant, got through but the next seven who\nfollowed him were shot dead in a circle of a few yards, picked oʃ by clean shooting\nwithout a murmur.’\nOn  the  second  night  of  the  battle,  Boustead  wrote,  ‘We  nearly  suʃered  complete\nannihilation from our own “steel footballs”—circular bombs with a long stick on which\nthe charge is propelled. They went on pitching among us for hours on end, curiously\ncausing no casualties, but they added to our terror.’ On the third day he went forward\nwith a party of snipers to try to pin the Germans down at Waterlot Farm. ‘Three of us\nspent  the  afternoon  there,’  he  wrote.  ‘There  were  already  six  South  African  Scottish\nlying dead in their ɹring places ahead of us, but we were able to eʃect quite a good\nshoot on the Germans moving from Waterlot and after a number of hits they stopped.’ A\nfew hours later, Boustead was wounded and left the battleɹeld. ‘My main relief was a","few hours later, Boustead was wounded and left the battleɹeld. ‘My main relief was a\nchance to get some sleep,’ he later recalled. ‘For ɹve days and nights we had hardly\nslept at all and at times I was conscious of a longing to get hit anywhere to be able to\nsleep.’\nTo the left of Delville Wood on July 15 the British managed to reach High Wood.

Rain and mist made any aerial\nspotting impossible, however, and far from the defences being broken up, the Germans,\nwho  realised  that  an  attack  was  imminent,  were  able  to  build  new  machine-gun\nemplacements. The preliminary British infantry attack on the following morning was\ndriven oʃ by machine-gun ɹre so intense that the next day’s attack was cancelled. On\nJuly 18, Harold Macmillan was injured. ‘The pair of spectacles which I was wearing\nmust have been blown oʃ by the force of the explosion,’ he wrote to his mother the\nnext day, ‘for I never saw them again.

The Australians, many of whom had fought the\nprevious summer, autumn and winter at Gallipoli, treated their harsh new tasks with\ncharacteristic irreverence, singing, to the tune of ‘The Church’s One Foundation’:\nWe are the Anzac Army,\nwww.frenchpdf.com","The A.N.Z.A.C.,\nWe cannot shoot, we don’t salute,\nWhat bloody good are we.\nAnd when we get to Ber-lin\nThe Kaiser he will say,\n‘Hoch, Hoch! Mein Gott, what a bloody odd lot\nTo get six bob a day!’\nThis was the Australians’ ɹrst oʃensive action on the Western Front. Its aim was to\nprevent the Germans from moving reinforcements to the Somme. On the eve of the\nbattle, General Elliott, the senior Australian oɽcer at Fromelles, alarmed by the strength\nof  the  German  position,  asked  a  British  Staʃ  Oɽcer,  Major  H.C.L.  Howard,  for  his\nestimate of how the attack would go. Howard replied: ‘If you put it to me like that sir, I\nmust answer you in the same way as man to man. It is going to be a bloody holocaust.’\nGeneral Elliott asked Howard to report his view back to Haig. He did so, his report\ncoinciding with Intelligence information that there was no longer any urgency for an\nattack,  as  German  troops  were  not  being  transferred  to  the  Somme,  and  did  not","attack,  as  German  troops  were  not  being  transferred  to  the  Somme,  and  did  not\ntherefore  need  to  be  pinned  down.  Haig’s  corps  commander,  General  Sir  Richard\nHaking, wanted the attack to go on, however, the headquarters record noting that ‘he\nwas quite conɹdent of the success of the operation, and considered that the ammunition\nat his disposal was ample to put the infantry there and keep them in’. Pressed to agree\nto a delay in the attack, Haking was emphatic: ‘The troops are worked up to it, were\nready and anxious to do it, and he considered that any change of plan would have a bad\neffect on the troops now.’\nTwo miles south of Fromelles was the high ground of Aubers Ridge, the objective of\nthe attack. The attack itself lay across a low, wet No-Man’s Land towards a strongly\nfortiɹed German salient, the Sugar Loaf, which overlooked the attackers’ approach. ‘I\nknow you will do your best for the sake of our lads who are ɹghting down south,’","know you will do your best for the sake of our lads who are ɹghting down south,’\nHaking told them on the eve of battle. In the church tower at Fromelles, reinforced by a\nconcrete  stairwell,  with  a  loophole  specially  designed  for  an  observer,  the  Germans\ncould see, throughout July 18, the preparations being made for the attack both in the\nfront-line trenches and those behind them. The assault began on the late afternoon of\nJuly 19, preceded by a day-long artillery barrage. The ɹrst Australian casualties were\ncaused by their own shells falling short, and by some heavy German artillery ɹre. When\nthe attack began, the German machine guns in the salient opened ɹre: the artillery had\nfailed to silence them.\nAn hour after the ɹrst men had gone over the top, General Elliott reported: ‘Every\nman who rises is being shot down. Reports from the wounded indicate that the attack is\nfailing from want of support.’ The wounded were streaming back. A British attack on","failing from want of support.’ The wounded were streaming back. A British attack on\nthe other side of the salient was also beaten back with heavy British casualties. Then, at\na point in the line a little way from the Sugar Loaf, the Australians reached a main\nGerman trench. ‘The enemy was caught in the act of manning his parapets, and some\nbitter  hand-to-hand  ɹghting  followed,’  the  battalion’s  historian,  Captain  Ellis,  later\nwrote. ‘It terminated, as all such hand-to-hand ɹghting terminated throughout the war,\nin  the  absolute  triumph  of  the  Australians  and  the  extinction  or  termination  of  the\nGermans.’\nThe Sugar Loaf Salient, which General Haking had ordered to be attacked ‘throughout\nwww.frenchpdf.com","the night’, eluded its attackers. As dawn broke, more wounded tried to get back to the\nAustralian lines. Many of them lay out in No-Man’s Land, ‘trying to call back to us’,\nSergeant H.R. Williams later wrote, ‘and in doing so made of themselves a target for the\nGerman machine gunners’. Those who managed to get back were like men ‘awakened\nfrom a nightmare’, Williams recalled. ‘The ordeal of the night was plainly visible on all\nfaces,  ghastly  white  showing  through  masks  of  grime  and  dried  sweat,  eyes  glassy,\nprotruding and full of that horror seen only on the face of men who have lived through\na heavy bombardment.’\nDuring the night, one group of Australians and some British soldiers had reached the\nouter wire of the Sugar Loaf, but were unable to push through it. The Australian oɽcial\nwar historian, C.E.W. Bean, visiting the battleɹeld in November 1918, shortly after the\nArmistice, wrote: ‘We found the No-Man’s Land simply full of our dead.

In the narrow\nsector west of the Sugar Loaf Salient, the skulls and bones and torn uniforms were lying\nabout everywhere. I found a bit of Australian kit lying ɹfty yards from the corner of the\nsalient, and the bones of an Australian oɽcer and several men within a hundred yards\nof it.

The battle at Fromelles was a\nbrief interlude, far from the Somme, during that vaster battle. Yet its casualties were\nhigh: 1,708 Australian dead and nearly 4,000 wounded. The British dead were at least\nfour  hundred.  The  German  dead  and  wounded  were  less  than  1,500  in  all.  Four","four  hundred.  The  German  dead  and  wounded  were  less  than  1,500  in  all.  Four\nhundred Australians were taken prisoner: they were marched by the Germans through\nLille.\nThe aim of the attack at Fromelles, to keep German troops back from the Somme,\nwas a failure. A successful counter-attack on July 20 showed the Germans that their line\nwas not in any serious danger. That day, on the Somme, an unprecedented, and perhaps\nunrepeated incident took place, recalled later by a British army chaplain: ‘The only\noccasion  when we have heard troops in battle break into a spontaneous and whole-\nhearted cheer was when after a half-hour’s single combat on July 20, 1916, a German\naeroplane  crashed  behind  our  lines,  with  the  full  glory  of  a  blood-red  sky  in  the\nbackground. The excitement had been so intense that on both sides the gunners had\nstopped firing to watch.’\n121\n***\nOn the Somme, the attack on Pozières was about to be renewed. ‘Why go to war with","121\n***\nOn the Somme, the attack on Pozières was about to be renewed. ‘Why go to war with\none another? With these men we have no quarrel,’ a young Australian schoolteacher,\nPrivate  Jack  Bourke,  wrote  in  a  letter  home  four  days  before  the  battle  began.  A\nGerman soldier, writing home on July 21, headed his letter ‘In Hell’s Trenches’ and\nadded: ‘It is not really a trench, but a little ditch shattered with shells—not the slightest\ncover and no protection. We have lost fifty men in two days and life is unendurable.’\nThe attack on Pozières was renewed on July 22. German troops had used the six days\nsince the previous attack to place a network of machine-gun posts in shell-holes in front\nwww.frenchpdf.com","of their main defences. The British night-time artillery bombardment, seen from afar,\nturned the whole skyline into ‘one ɻickering band of light’. As the newly arrived Anzac\nCorps went into action, there was little time or mood for mercy. One Australian oɽcer,\nLieutenant E.W.D. Laing, later recalled a German soldier who ‘tried to give himself up\nas soon as he saw our chaps on him. “Come out, you...”, yelled one of my men. I heard\nhim, rushed back shouting at the chap to shoot the swine or I would—so he got him.’\nSix Germans were killed in that sweep and eighteen captured. ‘The men had great\nsport chucking bombs down any hole they saw,’ Laing remembered.

The owner of the coat was a German and some\nmight say, not entitled to much sympathy. Perhaps he was not, but I could not help\nthinking sadly of the little girl or boy who had sent him the cakes.’\nThis was the second Australian baptism of ɹre on the Western Front in three days.\nContemporary letters and later recollections all testify to the severity and cruelty of the\nɹghting.  Lieutenant-Colonel  Iven  Makay  recalled  how,  as  the  Australians  advanced,\nmany  Germans  ‘remained  in  their  dug-outs,  terriɹed  and  had  to  be  bombed  or\nbayoneted out. Some never came out. A number of the German prisoners would not,\nthrough  pure  fright,  cross  No-Man’s  Land.  They  had  to  be  killed.’  In  the  Pozières\nmilitary cemetery is a memorial to 14,691 soldiers killed while attacking the ridge in","military cemetery is a memorial to 14,691 soldiers killed while attacking the ridge in\n1916,  1917  and  1918,  but  who  have  no  known  grave.

Moorhead\nlater recalled how, after his company had entered a deserted German trench, a captain\n‘ɹlled to the neck with rum’ ordered the men to continue ‘and dashed ahead again.\nFinally the survivors came back in a panic, calling out we must retreat, were all cut up,\nthe Germans were on us etc etc. The Captain had been shot through the heart on the\nbarbed wire.’ Not long afterwards the Germans attacked, the impetus of their thrust\nbroken by the Australian artillery. ‘When the Huns came into view over the crest in\ntwos and threes or singly, some with packs, probably ɹlled with bombs, others with\nɹxed bayonets, we lined the parapet like an excited crowd and blazed like hell at them,","ɹxed bayonets, we lined the parapet like an excited crowd and blazed like hell at them,\nknocking them over like rabbits, not a man getting away so far as I could see.

One  oɽcer\nappeared and waved his men forward in a lordly way, and then collapsed like a bag,\nfilled with our lead. I fired about 30 rounds and did my share.’\nA little while later there was a moment of black humour. ‘One unfortunate Boche,’\nMoorhead  recalled,  ‘having  run  the  gauntlet  of  our  riɻe  ɹre  was  getting  away\napparently only slightly wounded when one of our shells burst on him as though aimed,\nand he went up blown to pieces. Well, we cheered and laughed at the happening as\nthough it was the funniest thing in the world.’\nNot so funny was the experience of an Australian oɽcer, Captain W.G.M. Claridge,\nwho was wounded that day and sent to hospital in England. ‘I am not going to tell a lie","who was wounded that day and sent to hospital in England. ‘I am not going to tell a lie\nand  say  I  wasn’t  afraid,’  Claridge  wrote  to  his  parents  two  weeks  after  the  battle,\n‘because I was and who wouldn’t be with Death grinning at you from all around and\nwww.frenchpdf.com","hellish 5.9 inch shells shrieking through the air and shrapnel dealing death all round.

I suppose we may at any moment hear very good news from\nRussia—but it’s a very long time coming and the German war machine must be far from\nrun down if he can put up the fight he has done.’\n122\nOn July 29, a day after this infantryman’s pessimistic, or at least realistic, letter home,\nHaig received a letter from London, written by General Sir William Robertson, Chief of\nthe Imperial General Staʃ, warning him that ‘The powers-that-be are beginning to get a\nlittle  uneasy  in  regard  to  the  situation.’  This  concern  was,  Robertson  explained,\n‘Whether a loss of say 300,000 men will lead to really great results, because, if not, we","‘Whether a loss of say 300,000 men will lead to really great results, because, if not, we\nought to be content with something less than we are doing now.’ These same powers-\nthat-be, Robertson added, ‘are constantly enquiring why we are ɹghting and the French\nare not. It is thought that the primary object—relief of pressure on Verdun—has to some\nextent been achieved.’\nHaig had no doubt that the Somme oʃensive should continue. ‘In another six weeks,’\nhe replied, ‘the enemy should be hard put to ɹnd men. The maintenance of a steady\noʃensive  pressure  will  result  eventually  in  his  complete  overthrow.’  That  ‘steady\noʃensive pressure’ continued, but with no decisive result, and a steady mounting up of\nBritish casualties.

On that sector, south of the Pripet Marshes, the Austrian troops\nwere facing much larger Russian forces, 863,000 to 480,000. Understandably, they were\nalarmed.

So horrifying was the stench of\nRussian  corpses  in  No-Man’s  Land  that  the  Russians  asked  the  German  commander,\nGeneral Marwitz, for a truce in which they could bury the dead. Marwitz would not\nagree. There could be ‘no better deterrent to future oʃensives’, comments one historian,\n‘than this forest of rotting corpses’.\n175\nThe Austrians held oʃ the Russian attack. The Kowel oʃensive continued, but the\nAustrian line was not broken.

There, on August\n10, the British renewed the Ypres oʃensive, but the advance was impeded four days\nlater by heavy rain. On August 16 the village of Langemarck was taken, but a German\ncounter-attack recovered much of the ground gained. The initiative lay, however, with\nthe British, who were helped in capturing the fortiɹed German pillboxes by the use of\ntanks, and also by a ferocious French diversionary attack on the German lines at Verdun,\nwhen more than 5,000 Germans were taken prisoner.\nOn August 18, as the British and French were making steady gains on the Western\nFront, the Italians launched their eleventh battle on the Isonzo. Three days later a British","Front, the Italians launched their eleventh battle on the Isonzo. Three days later a British\nnurse on the Italian Front, Viscountess D’Abernon, wrote in her diary: ‘The camp has\nbeen submerged beneath an ever rising tide of wounded.

A munitions store ɹlled with grenades had also blown up. For the troops,\nwho always hoped for a few days’ leave in the city, writes the historian Alan Palmer, ‘it\nwas still possible to enjoy the natural beauty of the Gulf and to ɹnd some peace in the\nhills  behind  the  town.  But  there  were  many  high  spirits  who  looked  for  something\nnoisier; and Montmartre—or was it Babylon?—had gone up in smoke.

It was only possible to give nourishment by means of an india-rubber tube\npassed underneath. It seemed as though gangrene had already set in, yet he wrote down\nan anxious enquiry as to whether we thought he would ever “be able to sing again”.’ On\nAugust 24 she noted: ‘The stream of sick and wounded has swollen to a ɻood.’ On the\nprevious night 4,000 Austrian prisoners had passed through, on their way to be interned\nwww.frenchpdf.com","‘behind barbed and electrolised wire at Cividale.

The Austrians withdrew to a new line. Italy had gained six\nmiles of mountainous terrain. But there was a dark side also for the Italians: a growing\nnumber  of  desertions,  estimated  at  more  than  5,000  in  July  and  a  further  5,000  in\nAugust.\nOn the Western Front, the initial British promise was not maintained.

On the British sector of the Western Front\nspecial centres were set up in 1917 to deal with the increase in mental disorders, in\nparticular hysteria. The centres were given the acronym NYDN centres, standing for the\nsomewhat disingenuous ‘Not Yet Diagnosed (Nervous)’. As diagnosis was being made,\ngames  and  exercises  were  provided,  there  was  a  lending  library,  and  concerts  were\ngiven. The centres were established twelve to ɹfteen miles behind the line, so that the\nnoise of battle would be muted. After treatment, men who had broken down under","noise of battle would be muted. After treatment, men who had broken down under\ntheir experiences were sent back to Britain.\nOther  men,  judged  unstable  but  still  usable,  were  transferred  to  employment  and\nlabour companies in the back areas. Those judged ɹt to return to active service were\nsent to convalescent homes and given further training before being sent back to the\ntrenches. As many as a third of those brought to the centres were found to be only\ntemporarily  disordered.

Others were shattered for life.\nIn Britain, in addition to six peacetime hospitals that could deal with nervous disorders,\nan additional six hospitals for oɽcers and thirteen for other ranks were set up in 1917\nand 1918 to deal entirely with those whose mental balance had been disturbed by their\nexperiences in the trenches, and who had been sent home for ever.\n***","experiences in the trenches, and who had been sent home for ever.\n***\nWas there a way out of the stalemate on the Western Front? In a conversation with one\nof the King’s Private Secretaries on August 14, Lloyd George, who as early as January\n1915 had favoured striking at Austria as a way to victory, and who still wanted to focus\nBritain’s eʃorts on the Italian Front, spoke bitterly against his own military advisers.\nBritain had made ‘an egregious mistake’, he said, ‘in not throwing our weight on the\nside of Italy in order to smash Austria, take Trieste and then shake hands and make\nwww.frenchpdf.com","peace with Austria’. Summoned to meet the War Cabinet in London, on September 4\nHaig argued in favour of continuing the oʃensive on the Western Front. He was able to\nenlist in his support an appeal from Pétain for continued British activity to prevent a\nGerman  onslaught  on  the  French  positions,  still  weakened  by  the  aftermath  of  the\nmutinies. Pressure from the Italians for British troops to be sent to counter a possible\nAustrian oʃensive, and Lloyd George’s support for this, was discussed, but it was turned\ndown after Haig reiterated his confidence in breaking through the German lines.\n***\nTaking advantage of the turmoil inside Russia, during the ɹrst week of September the\nGermans achieved two victories at the extremities of the Eastern Front.

Throughout August, General Pershing, from his headquarters in Paris, had\nbeen establishing the basic structure for American participation in the war, still planned\nfor the summer of 1918. On August 13 he set up a Line of Communications system to\nlink  the  ports  with  the  bases  and  the  forward  depots.  On  August  20  he  created  a\nGeneral Purchasing Board, headed by a friend from his University of Nebraska days,\nCharles G. Dawes.\n176\n The Board’s ɹrst and immediate act was to order 5,000 aircraft\nand 8,500 lorries from the French. These were to be delivered by June 1918.

On the following day two\nAmerican soldiers, both engineers, were killed by German shellɹre while repairing a\nlight railway track at Gouzeacourt behind the lines.

Blundell did as he was ordered. As a reward for his action he was granted ten\ndays’ home leave. It began that same day. Seventy-two years later, as Blundell lay dying,\nhe repeated again and again, in the hearing of his son: ‘What a way to get leave, what a\nway to get leave.’\n***\nOn  September  6,  General  Pershing  moved  the  headquarters  of  the  American\nExpeditionary Force from Paris to Chaumont, near to what would most probably be the\nAmerican sector of operations. It was proving a hard task to have his men ready for\naction. That day Poincaré came to inspect the American troops. The parade ground had\nof necessity been hastily chosen, after dark, by the acting Chief of Staʃ, Captain George\nC. Marshall.\n178","C. Marshall.\n178\n It proved in the morning light to be irregular, churned up and muddy.\nThe President of France was not impressed, nor was Pershing, whose task was to turn\nthese men into ɹghting soldiers, and whose credo was discipline and smartness. To add\nto Pershing’s and the Allies’ problems, the American Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker,\ninsisted  that  no  American  troops  should  be  sent  to  the  front  until  they  were  fully\ntrained. When Clemenceau, who wanted to see the Americans in action swiftly, was told\nthat they were not yet ready, he replied acerbically that it was not a question of being\nready—nobody was ever fully ready—but of helping France, which was exhausted, had\nbeen bled white, and needed help. Pershing understood the almost desperate needs of\nhis allies, writing in his diary on September 15: ‘Recent British attacks beginning with\nthe latter part of July have been very costly and British morale not as high as two\nmonths ago.’","the latter part of July have been very costly and British morale not as high as two\nmonths ago.’\nSix days before Pershing wrote so gloomily, there had been an incident behind the\nlines,  at  Étaples,  where  British  soldiers  who  had  been  hospitalised  were  being  put\nthrough a tough two week retraining course in gas warfare and marching. Scuʀes broke\nout in the town between soldiers and the military police, the disturbances spread, and\nthe camp commandant and a dozen oɽcers were thrown into the river. But the men\nreturned to camp that night, and in the morning resumed their training. When further\ndisturbances broke out on September 12, aimed at the much disliked Military Police,\nreinforcements were called in and a cavalry brigade alerted. But when concessions were\nmade to the men, and the rigours of the training relaxed, calm was restored. The British\n‘mutiny’  had  been  a  muted  one.

Raising  the  red  ɻag  of  Bolshevism,  they  refused  to  go  to  the  trenches.  On\nSeptember 16 their camp was attacked by another Russian brigade of troops loyal to\nKerensky and the war. In what quickly became known as ‘The massacre of La Courtine’,\nseveral dozen Russians were killed. On the previous day, in Petrograd, Kerensky had\nwww.frenchpdf.com","declared a Republic.

But power\nwas slowly and inexorably passing to the Petrograd Soviet, which remained in session at\nthe Tauride Palace.\nGeneral Pershing, visiting the Russian camp at La Courtine, described it as ‘the vilest\nand most unsanitary place I have ever seen’. A joke was circulating about the Russian\nsoldiers on the Eastern Front that would have been comic but for the seriousness of\nRussia’s  failure  for  the  Western  Allies:  ‘How  far  did  the  Russians  retreat  today?’\n‘Fourteen kilometres, and they will retreat the same tomorrow.’ ‘How do you know?’\n‘That is as far as a tired German can walk.’\n***\nOn the day of the Russian revolt at La Courtine, ɹve hundred Egyptian labourers, who\nwere employed by the Allies unloading stores at Marseilles, also rioted.

After the ɹrst day of a British assault on Polygon Wood, on 26 September\n1917, Ludendorʃ wrote: ‘A day of heavy ɹghting, accompanied by every circumstance\nthat could cause us loss. We might be able to stand the loss of ground, but the reduction\nof our fighting strength was again all the heavier.’\nIn Britain, questions had begun to be raised about the continuing attrition. Although\nthe Germans were being pushed back a hundred yards here and a hundred yards there,\nthe casualty lists were growing. On September 27 the Chief of the Imperial General\nStaʃ, Sir William Robertson, wrote to Haig: ‘I confess I stick to it more because I see\nnothing better, and because my instinct prompts me to stick to it, than because of any\ngood arguments by which I can support it.’ On the following day Haig wrote in his","good arguments by which I can support it.’ On the following day Haig wrote in his\ndiary, ‘The enemy is tottering.’ This was his usual argument for continuing.\nIn the ɹrst six days of October, ɹve successive German counter-attacks were driven oʃ\nand  more  than  4,000  of  the  attackers  captured.  By  October  5  more  than  20,000\nGermans had been taken prisoner. But this was at a cost of an estimated 162,768 dead\nand wounded. Haig’s two most senior generals, Plumer and Gough, urged him to end\nthe oʃensive, but he would not do so. The British oʃensive was renewed on a six-mile\nfront on October 9. One of those who took part in it, Hugh Quigley, wrote home a few\ndays later, from hospital, about how ‘the oɽcers told us the usual tale, “a soft job”, and\nI reckon it might have been easy enough if we had had a decent start.

British\nshells, falling short, burst near groups of men trying to go forward. ‘But when the mud\nand smoke cleared away, there they were, dirty but untouched.
